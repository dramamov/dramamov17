=Keeping Up with Beauty=
(Adapted from "The Highborn Matron Reborn as the Pitiful Heiress")

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.240
A thousand years ago,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.039
the Great Liang Empire was torn
by internal strife and external threats.

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.600
Corrupt ministers conspired
with frontier generals,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.840
plotting a military coup.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.159
When the rebel cavalry
broke through the imperial city,

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:08.719
only Nangong Yu, commander
of the Southern Wind Camp,

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:11.680
led his soldiers to defend
the palace gates

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.359
(Nangong Yu, General of Great Liang)
to the death.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.660
(Commander of the Rebel Army)

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.639
General.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.199
(Command)
All members of the Southern Wind Camp, hear my command!

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.360
Fall back to the palace gates!

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.599
Protect His Majesty with all your might!

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:50.439
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.240
Release!

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.140
(Command)

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.940
(Command)

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.500
=Episode 1=

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:39.680
(Where am I?)

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:42.520
(Why am I still alive?)

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.319
You're awake.

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.840
Fu Yunyun.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.479
Don't think that killing yourself
will make me forgive you.

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:03.479
Who are you?

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:13.159
Stop pretending to be crazy.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.719
Grandmother treated you so well.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.120
Why did you try to harm her?

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.439
(Whose memories are these?)

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:26.759
(Have I been reincarnated,)

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.319
(or has my soul
entered someone else's body?)

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.780
(Fu Yunyun.)

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:43.560
Yunyun.

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:44.600
Come here.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.360
Yunyun.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.879
Don't be afraid.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.959
Your father is gone,

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.319
but we're all still here for you.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.720
Grandmother.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.759
Would you be willing
to marry our Chenyu?

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.360
From now on,
you'll be a member of the Gu family.

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.000
If anything happens, tell Grandmother.

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:07.560
Young Madam.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.920
Please come with me.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.720
Go on.

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:14.279
I'll go now, Grandmother.

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:16.000
Go on.

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:19.120
This is

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.439
our kitchen.

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:24.160
Mr. Zhao.

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:28.160
This corridor
leads to the front courtyard.

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:36.680
Go upstairs,

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.240
and the first room on the left
is the young master's bedroom.

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:41.959
Young Master.

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:45.600
Young Madam.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.879
I'll help you with your luggage.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.120
Thank you.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.639
You can have whatever you want,

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:54.839
but I hope
that aside from the Gu family,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.560
no one else will know
about our relationship.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.439
Conduct yourself wisely.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.120
(Father,)

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.240
(you won't have died in vain.)

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:29.079
(No matter how the Gu family treats me,)

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.319
(I will find the one who killed you,)

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:35.879
(and make the Gu family
pay the price they deserve.)

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:41.079
Let go of me!

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.680
I didn't kill anyone!
Why won't anyone believe me?

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.959
Let go of me!

00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:46.360
I didn't kill anyone!

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.000
I didn't kill anyone!

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:50.800
The maid saw it with her own eyes!

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.040
The old madam treated you so well!

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.199
How could you do such a thing?

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:55.000
I didn't kill anyone!
I'll go explain everything to them!

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.720
Explain what?

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:57.040
I'm telling you,

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:58.439
the young master is coming back soon.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.240
You'd better get ready
for prison or worse.

00:07:10.519 --> 00:07:11.639
Who are you?

00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:40.399
Fu Yunyun.

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:44.120
You harmed Grandmother
and now you want to kill me too?

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.800
Take me to the scene.

00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:48.759
I'll prove my innocence myself.

00:07:55.519 --> 00:07:57.759
Grandmother was perfectly
fine at dinner.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.240
She was poisoned late that night.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.260
The surveillance footage shows

00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:04.879
you were the only one
who entered her room.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:06.759
Who's in charge of the surveillance?

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.920
Tell him to come and face me directly.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.519
You still dare to joke
at a time like this?

00:08:10.519 --> 00:08:11.759
I'm not joking.

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:14.399
I'll face you myself.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.600
You're the surveillance?

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.600
What are you talking about?

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.040
The old lady
hadn't been sleeping well lately.

00:08:20.279 --> 00:08:22.240
I saw the light still on in her room,

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.439
so I went to check on her.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.519
That's when I saw you

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.000
feeding her a bowl of calming soup.

00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:30.279
Moments later, she was poisoned.

00:08:30.279 --> 00:08:31.519
Tell me,

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.240
apart from you,

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.480
who else could have poisoned her?

00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:37.039
Is the soup bowl
from that night still here?

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:38.799
Can you prove
there was poison in my soup?

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:40.080
You still dare to ask?

00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:41.200
Mr. Zhao.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.600
Young Madam washed the bowl
right after feeding the medicine.

00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:48.200
(So now there's no evidence left.)

00:08:48.279 --> 00:08:49.080
Fu Yunyun,

00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:51.000
the police are almost here.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.039
How will you prove your innocence now?

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.080
Could she really have done it?

00:08:56.639 --> 00:08:57.720
That's impossible.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.159
(If touching someone)

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.080
(lets me recall their memories,)

00:09:03.919 --> 00:09:04.720
(then…)

00:09:25.039 --> 00:09:25.720
Is it bitter?

00:09:25.879 --> 00:09:28.279
My granddaughter-in-law
made it so thoughtfully.

00:09:28.759 --> 00:09:29.590
No matter how bitter it is,

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.639
it still tastes sweet to me.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.080
Mother,

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.120
you're still not asleep?

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.440
Yunyun made me some calming soup.

00:09:37.799 --> 00:09:39.519
I just drank it.

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:42.159
After feeding her the medicine,
let Grandmother rest early.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.440
Go on, dear.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.080
Go now.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:45.799
Good night.

00:09:45.799 --> 00:09:46.120
All right.

00:09:50.919 --> 00:09:51.679
Grandmother,

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.200
what's this?

00:09:54.879 --> 00:09:57.559
Mr. Zhao brought it over this afternoon.

00:09:57.919 --> 00:10:00.080
He said the room was too plain,

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.320
so he placed this here
to brighten it up.

00:10:02.559 --> 00:10:03.480
It's quite nice.

00:10:03.759 --> 00:10:04.919
Then rest early.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.399
You too, rest early.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.159
What's wrong?

00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:18.399
What is this?

00:10:21.679 --> 00:10:22.919
Grandmother has asthma.

00:10:22.919 --> 00:10:24.360
That's her asthma medicine.

00:10:24.679 --> 00:10:25.440
Yes, Yunyun,

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.200
this medicine

00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:28.320
has always been prepared
for the old madam by Mr. Zhao.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.559
He knows best about it.

00:10:48.039 --> 00:10:48.840
Yun...

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.440
Yunyun...

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.679
This is ragweed.

00:11:09.039 --> 00:11:10.039
It's highly allergenic.

00:11:10.039 --> 00:11:11.360
It can easily trigger asthma.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.600
Mr. Zhao,

00:11:15.039 --> 00:11:16.600
why did you place it here?

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.039
If the old madam had an asthma attack,

00:11:19.039 --> 00:11:21.320
she would have to take
her asthma medicine immediately.

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:23.679
If the medicine was switched for poison…

00:11:24.039 --> 00:11:24.600
Young Master.

00:11:26.039 --> 00:11:26.720
Young Master.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.799
Don't slander me like that.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.360
I've served the Gu family
for twenty years.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.519
Whether it's poisoned or not,

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.200
a test will reveal the truth.

00:11:34.279 --> 00:11:35.240
Mr. Zhao,

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.879
was this really the medicine
you gave Grandmother?

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:41.720
I...

00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:43.080
I...

00:12:00.039 --> 00:12:00.559
Yunyun!

00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:01.559
I didn't want to do it!

00:12:01.799 --> 00:12:03.279
I... I owed gambling debts.

00:12:03.519 --> 00:12:04.639
The old madam found out,

00:12:04.639 --> 00:12:05.600
and she wanted to fire me!

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.120
Guards! Come quickly!

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.600
Hurry!

00:12:10.399 --> 00:12:11.679
Let me go!

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:12.879
Let me go!

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.720
Let me go!

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:20.320
Hello?

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:20.840
Brother,

00:12:21.159 --> 00:12:22.360
Grandmother's out of danger now.

00:12:22.559 --> 00:12:23.600
Good. I understand.

00:12:26.159 --> 00:12:27.960
Yansheng said
Grandmother's out of danger.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.120
Really?

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.519
Then if that's all,

00:12:30.519 --> 00:12:31.080
I'll take my leave.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:31.639
Stop.

00:12:31.639 --> 00:12:33.080
I just helped you find the culprit.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.240
Until we confirm whether the medicine
is poisoned or not,

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.879
you're not allowed
to leave the Gu residence.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.279
The Gu family?

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.159
Who cares.

00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:51.919
I'll come

00:12:51.919 --> 00:12:53.080
and go as I please.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.600
(My head hurts...)

00:13:00.799 --> 00:13:04.159
A bond sealed with life.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:09.840
A vow of life and death.

00:13:17.039 --> 00:13:18.480
(These memories appearing...)

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.990
(Could it be they're trying
to tell me something?)

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:23.879
Sister-in-law,

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.480
where are you sneaking off to?

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.519
Sister-in-law?

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:53.620
