00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.520
(This is a work of fiction)

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.920
You're quite jealous.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.560
Are you kidding?

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.920
I think that kid is nice.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.919
But don't say I didn't warn you.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.160
Don't take it too seriously.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.679
You two won't have...

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.999
a chance to be together anymore.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.239
As long as tomorrow comes,

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.600
his newfound interest in you...

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.200
will pass.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.720
Chen Jia Wen,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.920
you're just jealous.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.040
I'm jealous?

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.280
Why would I be jealous of him?

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.600
Four years have passed,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.360
and I'm still as charming as ever.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.080
Yet no one cares about you.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.640
You feel resentful.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.400
No one cares about me?

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.280
Shen Meng, let me tell you.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.240
In the past four years,

00:02:13.241 --> 00:02:15.560
there were girls who liked me.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.719
I just felt bad for you,

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.960
so I didn't tell you.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.320
You don't believe me? Fine.

00:02:23.321 --> 00:02:24.480
I believe you...

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.360
(It's quite good to be alone)

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.280
I'm going to post this now.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.600
Count down from five.

00:02:35.601 --> 00:02:37.001
Someone will definitely message me.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.360
(Post)

00:02:40.361 --> 00:02:41.719
(It's quite good to be alone)

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.720
Five.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.440
Four.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.560
Three.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.120
Two.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.240
One.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.800
(Lin Lin: Chen Jia Wen, did you guys break up?)

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.320
Can you stop moving around?

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.960
I just want to sit up straight.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:16.920
Don't lean on me.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.200
You're heavy.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.120
Let me tell you.

00:03:21.121 --> 00:03:22.161
You'd better hide it well.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.960
Don't let her see it.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.920
Otherwise, she will think...

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.320
I'm trying to ruin your chances.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.840
She won't.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.839
At most, it'll just expose...

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.960
your little desire of not wanting me to be with someone else.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.400
- Gosh. - I get it...

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.680
You wish.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.720
Lin Lin.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.640
- Over here. - Hi.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.160
- It's been a while. - Long time no see.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.800
Your arm is...

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.320
It's more relaxed...

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.840
to sit like this.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.240
This time,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.160
you guys really broke up?

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.240
Don't be sad.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.400
If you broke up, it means you're not compatible.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.840
You'll definitely meet someone more suitable for you.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.600
So, in the next few years,

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.960
won't you...

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.440
consider marriage anymore?

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.640
Not exactly.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.880
I've always longed for marriage.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.080
It's great that you think that way.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.040
Hello, miss.

00:04:40.041 --> 00:04:41.201
What would you like to drink?

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.000
She came here for marriage.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.040
- This one, please. - Okay, just a moment.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.600
Actually,

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.280
I came to see you this time...

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.320
because I want to tell you something.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.240
There's nothing we can't talk about.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.760
Do you remember...

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.720
the night we first met?

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.440
At that party,

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.640
everyone drank a lot.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.840
But that day,

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.360
you were so considerate.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.800
You took good care of everyone.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.120
I don't know if you still remember.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.600
That day, next to me,

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.880
my second aunt...

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.680
thinks you're really nice...

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:22.920
and considerate.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.080
My second aunt is also outstanding.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.679
She's considerate,

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.799
gentle,

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.080
and virtuous.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.240
She's also good at taking care of people.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.880
I wonder if you've considered that.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.680
You...

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.040
asked me out...

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.040
to introduce me to your second aunt?

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.440
That's right.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.640
My second aunt said...

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.799
you look like...

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.320
a good family man.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.480
You're not the one who wants to meet me?

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.440
What are you thinking?

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.040
I have a boyfriend, okay?

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.680
You still won't give up?

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.919
My social media post...

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.920
surely has some problems.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.920
(When you're heartbroken, you just want to drink by yourself)

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.920
It's okay.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.560
So what if no one cares about you?

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.480
Life goes on.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.120
Don't be impatient.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.200
What's going on?

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.160
Mr. Hu?

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.760
Did you order this?

00:06:48.761 --> 00:06:50.040
Of course.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.839
Doesn't your social media photo...

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.880
have a QR code?

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.319
I just ordered it for you first,

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.840
so we won't lose momentum.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.640
Why are you two here too?

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.760
We've always wanted to drink,

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.240
but there was no reason.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.200
Didn't you guys happen to break up?

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.440
What nonsense are you saying?

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.400
Dude,

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.120
even if you have bad luck in love,

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.680
you still have your friends.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.520
Let's face it together.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Let's show our stance!

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.520
Let's talk about this.

00:07:24.521 --> 00:07:25.880
They're drinking too fast.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.440
Let's call it a day.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.800
- Let go. - If you ask me,

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.480
Shen Meng seemed fine at first glance,

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.176
but the more you look at her, the more ordinary she seems.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.960
- Yes. - She's not very sensible.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.320
Not very considerate.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.000
And she doesn't show respect.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.200
Forget that she wouldn't let us play games,

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.519
she wouldn't let us drink too.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.920
She always looked down on us.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.120
Stop it.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.200
That's out of line.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.200
You used to treat her like your sister-in-law.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.320
Saying this now...

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.160
isn't good, in my opinion.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.360
Dude.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.240
Since she dumped you,

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.120
don't love her anymore.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.480
Dude.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.080
Actually, I think...

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.840
Shen Meng...

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.400
is quite nice.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.400
But she's not right for you.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.280
I think...

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.480
Princess...

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.720
is suitable for you.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.080
- Exactly. - Exactly.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.520
Who's Princess?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Princess is...

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.480
You're something else, Chen Jia Wen.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.120
You've hidden it so well.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.000
I've never even heard of her.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.680
She pestered me like crazy back then.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.960
I'm not interested in her at all.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.760
Since there's a woman who loves you so much,

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.760
ask her to meet you.

00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:47.920
You don't understand.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.039
I tried so hard...

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.679
to get rid of her back then.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.839
- Gosh... - I begged everyone...

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.559
to help me with my act of feigning death.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.560
She almost drove me to my death.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.639
She's that incredible? Then ask her to meet you.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.640
Let me see for myself.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.120
I can't call her anymore.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.320
I don't have her contact information anymore.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.960
That's why you're not calling her, right?

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.640
No.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
What are you doing?

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.240
Hello, Zhao?

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.280
Ask Princess to meet up.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.536
Tell her Chen Jia Wen is still alive...

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.560
and wants to see her.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.400
What are you doing?

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.160
Why don't you understand?

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.200
She's crazy.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.640
Everything will reset after midnight anyway.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.720
What are you afraid of?

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.400
Jia Wen.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.440
Jia Wen!

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.840
She seems to be coming.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.600
Jia Wen.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.920
Jia Wen!

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.840
Look.

00:10:04.841 --> 00:10:05.960
Look at her state of mind.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.439
She's wearing...

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.960
That's how she usually dresses.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.920
Chen Jia Wen!

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.120
Hi.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.560
I knew you weren't dead.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.480
Your arm...

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.640
It's nothing.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.080
It's nothing.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.080
All right.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:35.480
Let me take a good look at you.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.040
Have a seat.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.600
Let's sit and talk.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.200
Okay.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.200
I'll sit down.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.279
If you hadn't left me,

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.480
I wouldn't be like this today.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.720
Listen to me.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.840
No.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.360
Listen to me first.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.920
I must thank you properly.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.999
After you left me back then,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.359
I went to see a fortune teller.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.520
He told me my fortune.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.160
He said you're fated to bring bad luck to your wife.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.159
Whoever is with you will be unlucky.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.599
She'll spend as much as she earns.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.839
Not only can she not keep money,

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.720
she'll also be prone to nodules,

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.080
premature aging,

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.479
irregular period,

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.400
and darkening of the space between the eyebrows.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.720
Most importantly,

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.440
whoever is with you...

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.200
is destined to encounter a disaster.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.640
She can't escape it...

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.320
or dodge it.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.520
She might even lose her life.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.800
That's just superstition.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.960
- No! - No!

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.160
- It's definitely true. - It's definitely true.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.480
Hello.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.480
Hello.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:58.920
Is she your girlfriend?

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.600
I was just talking nonsense.
