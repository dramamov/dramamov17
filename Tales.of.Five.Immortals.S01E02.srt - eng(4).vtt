00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:34.640
The Immortal Hall follows the laws of nature.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.200
All the laws of nature gather as one.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.159
You're awake.

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.639
You.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.319
Why did you bring me here?

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.639
Darn it.

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:25.120
Wait, wait, wait.

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:26.319
Don't cry, please.

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:27.439
I'm trying to help you.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.960
Why are you crying now?

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.479
Thank you for rescuing me.

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:33.400
But we've angered the Immortal Huang Xian.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.319
If something happens in the village...

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.879
my family will be in even more trouble.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.280
What will my parents do?

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.199
Miss.

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:48.639
Give it back to me.

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:50.520
Can I ask you something?

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:52.280
Your village—

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:54.680
why are you all so afraid of the Immortal Huang Xian?

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:56.199
We're not afraid.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.520
We respect and revere it.

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:59.560
They say, years ago,

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:00.840
our village

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:02.560
was saved by the Immortal Huang Xian.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.280
There was a plague in the village.

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:10.560
The village doctor searched everywhere for medicine, but failed.

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:14.080
Until one night,

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:18.439
he got lost in the wild graveyard.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.319
Where am I?

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.039
This isn't how it looked before.

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:46.400
Great Immortal...

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:47.240
Spare me.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.080
Great Immortal, please spare me.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.439
Do I look like a human to you?

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.039
Great Immortal...

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.560
Please, spare me. Spare me.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.960
Do I look like a human to you?

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:03.240
Yes, yes.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.039
Thank you.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.520
This herb

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.360
is my way of repaying your help.

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.599
Take it home and boil it in water.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.520
Thank you, Great Immortal.

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.279
The doctor took the herb back and made a brew.

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:23.319
Unexpectedly,

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.399
everyone in the village

00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:25.879
actually recovered.

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:26.879
So,

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:28.519
we built the Yellow Immortal Temple.

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:29.519
We've worshipped it ever since.

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:34.279
The Immortal Huang Xian blessed us.

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:36.759
So every new bride

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
must spend a night at the Yellow Immortal Temple.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.639
To pray for children,

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:43.000
and for good fortune.

00:04:59.079 --> 00:04:59.720
There's news.

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:00.319
Yes.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.600
The age and the artifact match.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.720
Where is he?

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.720
Zhang Family Village.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.439
Alright.

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.519
Get ready, we're leaving soon.

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:10.439
Miss.

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.040
If he really is Young Master Laifu,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.040
what will you do?

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.040
Kill him.

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.040
The Immortal Huang Xian is angry.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.079
It's because we didn't send the new bride.

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:28.319
Immortal Huang Xian, please calm your anger.

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:29.079
Immortal Huang Xian, please calm your anger.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.199
Immortal Huang Xian, please calm your anger.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.800
I heard the Immortal Huang Xian is causing trouble here.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.199
Who is this? I don't know him.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.199
This Second Master Huang is a weasel who became immortal.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.120
If angered, he just causes mischief.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.399
Makes people act strangely.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.759
When did he start killing people?

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.639
Who is this lady?

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:48.040
She's from the House of Bai.

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:49.319
From the House of Bai.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.680
The eldest daughter of the House of Bai.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.399
So it's Miss Bai.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.360
Sorry for not greeting you sooner.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.120
May I ask what brings you to our village?

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:01.519
You're the village chief, right?

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.560
Yes, I am.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.439
I'm looking for someone named Laifu.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.560
Have you seen him?

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:07.040
Laifu?

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:07.879
Chief.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.399
Chief.

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:12.439
Something happened at my house.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.079
What happened?

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:15.920
Last night, I was sleeping soundly.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.399
Suddenly, I heard a rooster crow.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.680
So I got up to take a look.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.160
Mom.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.319
What are you doing up so late?

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.079
Mom.

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:39.000
What are you doing?

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.120
Mom.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.639
Mom.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.160
Mom.

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:12.399
The Immortal Huang Xian has cursed us.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.319
No one can escape.

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:18.920
It must be the Immortal Huang Xian's curse.

00:07:19.079 --> 00:07:20.199
It possessed my mother.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.240
Chief.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.959
It must be that boy who took Wanting.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.199
The Immortal Huang Xian is angry.

00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:26.560
Where is he, anyway?

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.439
Who knows?

00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:28.839
There are so many people.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.360
They're waiting for me.

00:07:31.959 --> 00:07:33.040
You're finally back.

00:07:33.439 --> 00:07:34.040
That's him.

00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:35.720
He's the one who took Wanting.

00:07:37.079 --> 00:07:38.759
Seems a lot happened yesterday.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.079
So it was you causing trouble.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.519
Pretending to be the Immortal Huang Xian to stir up trouble.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.199
Did you do anything to Wanting?

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:46.959
Tie him up and offer him to the Immortal Huang Xian.

00:07:47.079 --> 00:07:47.560
No!

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:48.720
Grab him!

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.360
Don't run!

00:07:49.439 --> 00:07:50.480
I'm really trying to help you!

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.480
I didn't take her!

00:07:51.519 --> 00:07:52.240
Tie him up!

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.199
It's all your fault.

00:07:55.399 --> 00:07:56.000
Save him?

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.800
It's all because of you—him!

00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:01.879
What are you all doing?

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:02.920
You've angered the Immortal Huang Xian.

00:08:03.079 --> 00:08:04.319
You're way too bold.

00:08:15.199 --> 00:08:16.959
Don't be fooled by my thin looks.

00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:18.519
I'm actually quite strong.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:19.639
Yes, yes.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.519
Easy, easy.

00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:21.240
Easy.

00:08:21.319 --> 00:08:21.879
Easy.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.439
What if someone gets hurt?

00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:24.519
Exactly.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.199
Great Immortal...

00:08:28.079 --> 00:08:29.959
This young man is from out of town.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.839
He doesn't know our village's rules.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.159
If he sincerely apologizes,

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:36.000
please forgive him this time.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:43.360
No.

00:08:43.759 --> 00:08:45.399
No matter what you hear soon,

00:08:45.639 --> 00:08:46.799
do not open your eyes.

00:08:47.039 --> 00:08:48.679
Keep them shut and you'll stay alive.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.200
Where are you all going?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.080
Groom!

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.399
May you have a lifetime of harmony.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.600
Groom!

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.360
A fine marriage.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.720
Congratulations.

00:09:20.519 --> 00:09:21.559
Such joy!

00:09:22.559 --> 00:09:24.200
Cheers!

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.720
A good thing.

00:09:29.639 --> 00:09:31.399
Cheers!

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:33.240
Congratulations.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.440
A talented groom and a lovely bride.

00:09:37.639 --> 00:09:40.919
A match made in heaven.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.720
Cheers!

00:09:51.159 --> 00:09:52.120
Groom!

00:09:52.639 --> 00:09:54.600
Why did you arrive so late?

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.480
The bride's been waiting anxiously.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:59.879
How wonderful.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.279
Congratulations.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.360
First bow: to heaven and earth.

00:10:06.039 --> 00:10:07.919
Second bow: to your elders.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.039
Third bow: to each other.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.200
The final salute.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.759
Drink the wedding wine.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.519
May you never part till old age.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.080
I've had enough fun with you.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.399
Righteous celestial power, light of the Seven Stars!

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.000
All evil spirits, scatter with the wind!

00:10:55.159 --> 00:10:56.279
You have another trick?

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.000
Groom, do you think you can escape?

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.799
I don't care if you're the Immortal Huang Xian or not.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.320
Your time is up.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.000
Using incense as a cover,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.360
your smoke trick can't fool me.

00:11:09.399 --> 00:11:10.360
So it was you after all.

00:11:10.559 --> 00:11:12.200
You actually broke my illusion.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.600
You've got some real skill.

00:11:13.919 --> 00:11:15.600
But this time, you'll fall to me.

00:11:15.799 --> 00:11:17.480
It's just your bad luck.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:18.960
Do it!

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.200
You old bastard!

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.799
You really want me dead, huh?

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.159
No respect for law or heaven!

00:11:26.879 --> 00:11:28.120
Lawless!

00:11:28.559 --> 00:11:30.120
Here, I am the law!

00:11:30.799 --> 00:11:31.360
Stop!

00:11:33.279 --> 00:11:34.200
This is one of the House of Bai.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.159
Let's see who dares touch him.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.120
Who are you?

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.679
You don't recognize me?

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.039
You really don't know me?

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.919
You don't even respect the House of Bai?

00:11:46.799 --> 00:11:47.559
The House of Bai.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.399
Out here, the emperor is far away.

00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:51.080
I could kill you all and dump you in the ravine.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.240
Who could stop me?

00:11:52.519 --> 00:11:52.759
Do it!

00:11:52.919 --> 00:11:53.360
You.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.399
Spirit gives birth to all, guided by the underworld.

00:11:55.519 --> 00:11:56.720
I cast a command, spirits roam everywhere.

00:11:56.879 --> 00:11:57.799
Reveal yourselves at once!

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.600
Defy me and enter the realm of oblivion.
