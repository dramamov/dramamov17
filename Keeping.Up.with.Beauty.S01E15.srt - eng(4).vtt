00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.439
Do I still have a home?

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.920
You still have me.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.560
I'll stay with you for a while.

00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:12.760
I believe Yansheng and Shiqi

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.599
will understand you one day.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.799
Will you stay with me forever?

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:27.239
I...

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.359
Yunyun.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.719
Yunyun.

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.760
Actually, I...

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.400
Mr. Gu.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.280
This financial report needs your...

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:52.799
You two talk first.

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.000
I'll take a call.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.359
Mr. Gu.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.439
Is it too late to apologise now?

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:17.520
Miss Fu.

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.960
Although Mr. Gu held a press conference

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.520
to prove our restaurant's innocence,

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.879
our business
has still been greatly affected.

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:24.879
There's no one here.

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:27.639
What turnover

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:29.800
could there be now?

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.759
We can't go on like this.

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:32.599
Uncle Wang,

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.599
it'll take time

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.520
for customers
to regain trust in Jiangxing.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.400
Don't worry yet.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.759
Let's think of something together.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.759
Can I not worry?

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:41.560
Yunyun.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.759
Muyan.

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:45.520
Why are you here?

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.120
Congratulations on reopening the hotel.

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:48.520
Thank you.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.039
Also,

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:53.759
I guessed you might need some help.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.000
Muyan, what are you doing?

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.960
Here.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.759
Smile.

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:23.520
A selfie.

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.400
At my favourite restaurant,
watching the most beautiful view

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.960
with the most important person to me.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.308
(Zhao Muyan: At my favourite restaurant,)

00:03:53.308 --> 00:03:54.980
(watching the most beautiful view
with the most important person to me.)

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.520
The second party's quotation,
compared with the same quarter last year,

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.759
has decreased by 3.4 percent.

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:00.919
Regarding this,

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:02.400
Mr. Gu, what's your opinion?

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:06.680
Mr. Gu.

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:14.360
Mr. Gu.

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:15.080
Mr. Gu.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.600
Mr. Gu.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.240
Chenyu.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.279
What did you just say?

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.959
All parties unanimously agree

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:31.079
that within one year
from the signing of this agreement,

00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:32.399
except as required by applicable laws

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:34.800
or competent government authorities,

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.399
without prior written consent
from all parties,

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:39.199
no party, employee, consultant,

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:40.600
intermediary, or agent

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.279
shall disclose any information
or documents obtained

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:44.959
that have not been released

00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:47.720
or made public in any other form
related to this capital increase.

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.120
- Muyan.
- Muyan.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.759
Thank you.

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:00.839
So handsome!

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:04.199
I want a photo too!

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:05.040
Thank you.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.000
Hello.

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:09.600
Can I take a photo with you?

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.980
Sure.

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:14.040
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.600
How was it?

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:20.480
We owe you a lot today.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.360
Don't mention it.

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:24.560
Your matters are my matters.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.079
I didn't expect
so many people to come today.

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:26.680
So many.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.519
Mr. Zhao,

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:28.879
thank you especially for today.

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:30.360
You not only helped promote us for free,

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.800
but also worked here all day.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.920
Really, thank you.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.399
You're welcome.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.199
Miss Fu, I'll go handle something first.

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:39.360
You two take your time.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.279
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.920
Muyan,

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.600
you've already helped me enough.

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:49.360
From now on,
don't see yourself as my subordinate.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.879
We are equals.

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:51.800
I understand.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.360
But in my heart,

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.680
you're not just my General.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.199
You're also
the most important person to me.

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:18.040
Yunyun.

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:19.959
Sit down quickly.

00:06:19.959 --> 00:06:21.480
Don't tear your wound open.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.279
Shiqi made this for you.

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:27.199
She asked me to bring it.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.519
How is she?

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.279
She cried for two days

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.480
and much better now.

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:35.720
Eat it while it's hot.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.600
I'll head back first.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.360
Can you stay
and eat with me for a while?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.079
I still have to make things
clear with you.

00:06:47.079 --> 00:06:47.680
Right now, I...

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.120
You're my sister-in-law now.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:49.920
I know.

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:51.879
Don't worry.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.120
I won't do those childish things again.

00:06:57.519 --> 00:06:58.319
That's good.

00:07:02.519 --> 00:07:04.399
Shiqi made quite a few dishes.

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:05.800
She said they're all your favorites.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.600
Try them while they're warm.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.279
Yunyun.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.519
Mm?

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.360
I'm sorry.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.879
Those three words,

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.279
I should've said them to you long ago.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.079
All this time,

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:24.759
I was only focused on
hating you and getting revenge.

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:27.600
I never once stood in your place

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.600
or thought for you.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.600
I never even sat down
to speak calmly with you.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.639
I'm sorry.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.199
It's not too late for you
to understand now.

00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:45.199
When my mom got into trouble,

00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:49.360
I began to understand a little.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.720
After your father passed away,

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.800
you must have felt the same way.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.600
You must have been
terrified and helpless.

00:07:58.519 --> 00:08:00.600
And I was studying abroad at that time,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.279
knowing nothing,

00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:04.000
unable to help you.

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:06.920
How could I still blame you
for marrying my brother?

00:08:10.079 --> 00:08:12.160
You must have
had your reasons back then.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.399
If everything could start over,

00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:20.600
I'd never go abroad.

00:08:21.279 --> 00:08:22.959
I'd choose to stay by your side

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.879
and go through all of this with you.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.120
(If the original Fu Yunyun
could hear what you're saying,)

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.320
(she would be very happy.)

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.200
(It's just a pity...)

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:47.840
It's okay.

00:08:48.039 --> 00:08:50.000
Fu Yunyun has already forgiven you.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.120
She also said,

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.799
she wishes you a speedy recovery.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.720
Alright now,

00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.600
eat while it's hot.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.000
Does it taste good?

00:09:15.759 --> 00:09:16.559
(Yunyun,)

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.200
