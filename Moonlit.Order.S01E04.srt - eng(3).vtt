So,

00:09:42.461 --> 00:09:44.381
Stepmother, you mean

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.381
there happened to be a rogue,

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:49.861
who likes men.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.021
And he happened to target Dongyang

00:09:52.221 --> 00:09:53.580
to come to commit immoral acts.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:54.741
You happened

00:09:54.861 --> 00:09:56.540
to enter as Dongyang was being stripped.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.420
And you came to stop the rogue.

00:09:58.861 --> 00:10:00.456
Right after he fled,

00:10:00.456 --> 00:10:01.352
we came in.

00:10:01.352 --> 00:10:02.221
Therefore,

00:10:03.101 --> 00:10:04.381
we happened to see this scene?

00:10:05.141 --> 00:10:07.021
(Suddenly, she's so clever.)

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.221
Exactly.

00:10:18.101 --> 00:10:18.820
Get dressed well.

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.221
Let's not dwell on such coincidences.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.300
Instead, let's talk about

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:26.540
what the rogue

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:27.780
looks like.

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:29.700
We should report this.

00:10:30.101 --> 00:10:30.621
Indeed.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.580
Ms. Wang, tell us in detail.

00:10:34.101 --> 00:10:35.180
Dongyang, you'd tell us.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.221
Is it as Ms. Wang described?

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:38.780
(Oh no.)

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:41.101
- Sir.
- Well...

00:10:41.101 --> 00:10:41.780
You can't enter!

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:42.381
Move!

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.141
Who's making such noise outside?

00:10:45.101 --> 00:10:46.820
On behalf of the Jing'an Bureau,
I am here

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.741
to capture a rogue.

00:10:50.461 --> 00:10:52.261
- There really is a rogue?
- There really is a rogue?

00:10:52.261 --> 00:10:53.420
There really is a rogue?

00:10:54.021 --> 00:10:55.141
There really is a rogue?

00:10:55.501 --> 00:10:56.580
There really is a rogue?

00:10:59.341 --> 00:11:00.381
I mean,

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:01.741
there really is a rogue.

00:11:02.381 --> 00:11:03.621
How are the men

00:11:06.741 --> 00:11:07.780
of the Xue family here?

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:12.981
As an imperial official,

00:11:13.501 --> 00:11:14.341
guarding the people

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.341
is my lifelong duty.

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:17.341
Therefore,

00:11:17.501 --> 00:11:19.461
I must personally verify

00:11:19.461 --> 00:11:20.060
whether

00:11:20.141 --> 00:11:22.461
both young masters
were assaulted by the rogue.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:23.861
Only then

00:11:24.141 --> 00:11:24.981
will I

00:11:25.861 --> 00:11:26.981
find peace.

00:11:29.861 --> 00:11:30.300
Dongyang,

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:32.420
come here.

We're perfectly fine, Mr. Gu.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:38.621
In that case,

00:11:39.261 --> 00:11:39.981
it's late now,

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:41.621
let's go to sleep then.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:44.461
Mr. Gu,

00:11:44.981 --> 00:11:46.900
we won't hold you up anymore.

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:48.221
(Does)

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:49.621
(Feng Zuoren already know)

00:11:49.621 --> 00:11:51.021
(who the former Crown Prince is?)

00:11:51.141 --> 00:11:52.501
(I must never let him know)

00:11:52.501 --> 00:11:53.820
(Dongyang's birthmark.)

00:12:06.861 --> 00:12:08.381
(She'll surely make another move.)

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:10.381
(I must keep an eye on her.)

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:11.621
(Stepmother)

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:13.501
(indeed has a crush on Dongyang.)

00:12:14.981 --> 00:12:16.040
Grandmother,

00:12:16.381 --> 00:12:18.021
she dresses up gorgeously every day,

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.101
flaunting herself.

00:12:19.461 --> 00:12:21.300
Lord is unconscious.
It's improper for her

00:12:21.501 --> 00:12:22.660
to act like this.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:24.221
Is this true?

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.180
It's absolutely true.

00:12:26.741 --> 00:12:28.221
Ask the servants.

00:12:30.021 --> 00:12:32.141
People need dressing.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.060
In these troubled times,

00:12:34.461 --> 00:12:37.101
many look down on
our Lord Dingyuan Mansion.

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:41.780
Yet Ms. Wang maintains
such dignified dressing,

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.700
this is what a madam should do.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:49.060
Wait.

00:12:49.501 --> 00:12:50.141
Grandmother,

00:12:50.741 --> 00:12:51.861
not only that.

00:12:52.621 --> 00:12:53.660
As a stepmother,

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.780
she spends every day with Dongyang.

00:12:56.341 --> 00:12:57.621
Even acts intimately

00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:58.940
with Hexu.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.780
This proves

00:13:01.341 --> 00:13:03.700
she's embraced her role as stepmother,

00:13:04.261 --> 00:13:05.820
caring for her stepsons.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.660
Ms. Wang shares a kind heart as you.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.021
She's sincere to people.

00:13:11.741 --> 00:13:14.221
I am truly blessed

00:13:14.501 --> 00:13:16.700
to have you two.

00:13:19.621 --> 00:13:21.741
(Why is she so partial?)

00:13:27.381 --> 00:13:29.021
Dongyang is not smart.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:31.900
If that stepmother

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.660
tricks him into expelling me,

00:13:35.461 --> 00:13:37.540
my father already scorns me
for marrying Dongyang.

00:13:38.461 --> 00:13:41.160
Where could I possibly go then?

00:13:42.341 --> 00:13:43.501
I have no one to rely on.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.861
Who can help me?

00:13:46.861 --> 00:13:48.381
Me.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:49.820
Where? Who are you?

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:50.261
Where?

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:52.104
Who are you?

00:13:54.501 --> 00:13:55.621
Mr. Gu?

00:13:58.940 --> 00:13:59.741
I noticed you

00:14:00.501 --> 00:14:03.060
have been troubled
by Mr. Dongyang's affairs lately.

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:04.221
Therefore,

00:14:04.341 --> 00:14:06.300
I wish to help relieve your burdens.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.461
Wait. Although you were
sent by the Grand Tutor

00:14:09.461 --> 00:14:10.261
to protect us,

00:14:10.981 --> 00:14:12.261
you are being overly attentive.

00:14:13.341 --> 00:14:14.180
What do you want?

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:18.060
You...

00:14:19.501 --> 00:14:21.300
(Liu Jiaoqian seems foolish.)

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:22.820
(Could she be pretending?)

00:14:24.981 --> 00:14:26.420
You must be in love with me.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:27.784
Let me tell you.

00:14:27.784 --> 00:14:29.580
My devotion to Dongyang is unwavering.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:30.501
Don't even try.

00:14:31.141 --> 00:14:32.261
Stop dreaming.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.741
Don't put on a show there.

00:14:41.861 --> 00:14:42.660
It's useless.

00:14:48.021 --> 00:14:49.352
Actually, I also

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:50.900
can't stand that Ms. Wang

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:52.820
seducing Mr. Dongyang.

00:14:54.741 --> 00:14:55.461
What do you mean?

00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.060
You are kind-hearted,

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:00.861
couldn't figure out any trick.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:02.580
But I have a plan

00:15:03.261 --> 00:15:04.420
to make Ms. Wang

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.261
vanish from Xue Mansion.

00:15:11.221 --> 00:15:11.900
How could I

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.128
possibly collaborate with you

00:15:13.128 --> 00:15:13.940
against my family?

00:15:14.221 --> 00:15:14.940
Ridiculous!

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:20.141
Tell me.

00:15:25.096 --> 00:15:27.528
(Xue Mansion)

00:15:30.021 --> 00:15:31.741
Good news!

00:15:32.261 --> 00:15:34.060
The Grand Tutor sent us an invitation

00:15:34.461 --> 00:15:36.060
to attend the Flower Banquet,

00:15:36.461 --> 00:15:38.341
and specified that every madam

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.300
must bring a signature dish.

00:15:40.741 --> 00:15:42.060
We're all invited.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:43.820
Such an honor!

00:15:47.848 --> 00:15:50.504
(Invitation from the Grand Tutor)

00:15:50.504 --> 00:15:55.272
(Grand Tutor's Mansion)

00:16:02.461 --> 00:16:03.101
Come on.

00:16:05.221 --> 00:16:06.300
Is the dish prepared?

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.021
Yes.

00:16:07.021 --> 00:16:07.700
Ready?

00:16:07.912 --> 00:16:08.420
Good.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:09.141
Go in.

00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:10.261
Ready?

00:16:12.101 --> 00:16:12.540
Good.

00:16:13.416 --> 00:16:13.900
Go in.

00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:16.300
Stand there and wait.

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.021
Elder Princess will arrive soon.

00:16:23.501 --> 00:16:25.141
Grand Tutor Zhou must be up to no good.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.341
Mr. Xue Hexu.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.540
Greetings, Grand Tutor Zhou.

00:16:35.741 --> 00:16:37.621
No need for formalities.

00:16:39.461 --> 00:16:42.780
This must be your father's new wife?

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.300
I am Ms. Wang, greetings, Grand Tutor.

00:16:48.381 --> 00:16:49.420
Ms. Wang?

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:52.741
Indeed young and beautiful.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:54.981
Yet I've heard

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.221
before the wedding ceremony,

00:16:57.741 --> 00:17:00.261
Lord Xue was already terminally ill

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:01.064
and unconscious.

00:17:01.064 --> 00:17:02.141
I wonder

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:04.741
how the ceremony was performed.

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:06.461
It doesn't matter.

00:17:06.981 --> 00:17:08.941
For someone so young and beautiful,

00:17:09.741 --> 00:17:11.461
you must be skilled at something.

00:17:13.261 --> 00:17:14.780
Since marrying Lord Dingyuan,

00:17:15.501 --> 00:17:16.620
I am part of the Xue family.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.181
Yet your guards always monitor us.

00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:22.780
I wonder what you're up to.

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:24.421
My stepmother

00:17:24.661 --> 00:17:26.540
shares a profound affection
with my father.

00:17:26.941 --> 00:17:27.901
As for our Xue family,

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:29.421
her loyalty runs deep.

00:17:30.181 --> 00:17:30.701
However,

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:32.661
with your guards

00:17:32.661 --> 00:17:33.901
watching us every day,

00:17:34.181 --> 00:17:35.181
we wouldn't be in danger.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:37.300
Thus, on behalf of the Xue family,

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:38.501
thank you.

00:17:39.021 --> 00:17:39.701
No need.

00:17:40.181 --> 00:17:41.941
Just thank His Majesty.

00:17:42.501 --> 00:17:43.860
Take good care of your father.

00:17:44.221 --> 00:17:44.741
Look,

00:17:44.941 --> 00:17:46.100
she truly

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.661
shares such affection
with the unconscious Lord.

00:17:49.021 --> 00:17:50.780
Truly enviable.

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.580
You two cooperate seamlessly.

00:17:56.021 --> 00:17:57.140
- What?
- What?

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.100
Sweet!

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:17.941
Your Highness.

00:18:19.941 --> 00:18:21.820
Sorry for not properly welcoming you.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:29.540
Your Highness.

00:18:35.701 --> 00:18:37.140
Your Highness.

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:53.661
How dare you!

00:18:57.901 --> 00:18:58.380
Step back.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:18:59.701
Fix your hair.

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:01.261
Yes.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.060
This way, please.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.380
Your Highness, this way, please.

00:19:12.941 --> 00:19:13.540
Mind the steps.

00:19:13.901 --> 00:19:14.580
Mind the steps.

00:19:15.528 --> 00:19:16.580
Please be seated.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.380
Today, Elder Princess and Princess

00:19:29.421 --> 00:19:30.741
come to the Flower Banquet,

00:19:31.261 --> 00:19:32.981
bringing honor to my mansion.

00:19:33.261 --> 00:19:35.540
I've invited madams
from various noble families

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.380
to prepare a dish.

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:41.661
Elder Princess and Princess,
please enjoy.

00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:43.100
You are so thoughtful.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:44.421
I'm honored.

00:19:44.421 --> 00:19:45.501
Today, we shall

00:19:45.501 --> 00:19:47.701
join the fun with you all.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:48.340
Okay.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.620
Now, please

00:19:50.981 --> 00:19:52.820
present your dishes.

00:19:53.501 --> 00:19:54.981
(I knew you are up)

00:19:55.181 --> 00:19:56.300
(to no good.)

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.741
(When everyone doesn't notice,)

00:20:01.181 --> 00:20:03.421
(I'll present the signature dish
from Piaoxiang House,)

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:05.620
(Prosperity Supreme.)

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.140
Your Highnesses,

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.901
my dish is
Luxurious Seafood And Poultry.

00:20:30.421 --> 00:20:30.901
Please.

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:34.340
Truly luxurious.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.421
Delicacy.

00:20:37.941 --> 00:20:38.901
Thank you.

00:20:48.221 --> 00:20:49.461
Your Highnesses,

00:20:49.701 --> 00:20:51.701
my dish is Phoenix-Tail Shark Fin.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.380
Remarkable enough.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:00.901
Appreciate it.

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:05.701
And your dish?

00:21:14.501 --> 00:21:16.421
My dish is Prosperity...

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:21.701
(Where is it?)

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:23.701
What is this?

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:30.701
(It's her.)

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.701
How dare you disrespect
the Flower Banquet!

00:21:35.901 --> 00:21:37.901
This insults Elder Princess.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.140
You prepared nothing.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.741
Aren't you insulting
Elder Princess and Princess?

00:21:43.181 --> 00:21:44.661
Such disrespect

00:21:45.021 --> 00:21:46.580
invites you execution.

00:21:53.221 --> 00:21:53.860
How dare you!

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.060
Madam, explain yourself.

00:21:57.461 --> 00:21:57.941
Well?

00:21:58.461 --> 00:21:59.501
You wield a knife

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:01.501
to commit suicide?

00:22:01.741 --> 00:22:02.580
This dish

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.421
requires live preparation.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:06.221
Who is she?

00:23:06.661 --> 00:23:08.300
With such astonishing skills!

00:23:09.261 --> 00:23:11.021
I've never seen such an amazing skill

00:23:11.741 --> 00:23:13.181
before.

00:23:13.941 --> 00:23:15.060
You must be

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.860
the newly wedded Ms. Wang

00:23:17.221 --> 00:23:18.100
of the Xue family?

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:19.580
Your Highness,

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:21.100
exactly.

00:23:21.741 --> 00:23:23.901
Does this dish bear a name?

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:34.021
Peony receives heavenly grace,

00:23:34.901 --> 00:23:36.941
forever stays with the azure skies.

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:40.860
It's named 'Peony with Azure Skies'.

00:23:41.941 --> 00:23:42.540
Superb!

00:23:43.021 --> 00:23:44.661
Name and dish complement perfectly,

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:46.261
what a good match!

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:47.501
Good match!

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:49.941
You and your wife

00:23:50.181 --> 00:23:51.261
make a good match indeed.

00:23:51.941 --> 00:23:52.540
Mother,

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:53.860
they're not a couple.

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:55.140
I know

00:23:55.501 --> 00:23:56.580
they are a couple.

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:59.181
(- A couple?
- A couple?)

00:23:59.421 --> 00:24:00.901
(- I rather die.
- I rather die.)

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:04.701
Mother, no.

00:24:05.261 --> 00:24:07.620
This madam is Mr. Xue's...

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:09.780
His wife.

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:12.421
With such a skill,

00:24:12.901 --> 00:24:15.021
you can be a model of them all.

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:16.741
Your skill

00:24:17.261 --> 00:24:18.741
must require practices

00:24:18.941 --> 00:24:20.181
day and night.

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:22.501
(As the commander of the Xue Guardian,)

00:24:22.741 --> 00:24:23.741
(I killed many.)

00:24:24.221 --> 00:24:25.461
(My skill is surely supreme.)

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:41.981
This seems plain.

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:44.421
It looks pretty.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:46.340
Mrs. Xue.

00:24:46.661 --> 00:24:47.421
Mrs. Xue.

00:24:47.421 --> 00:24:49.820
Your skill is so amazing.

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:51.100
You did

00:24:51.261 --> 00:24:52.661
those floral carvings so well.

00:24:52.741 --> 00:24:53.501
It captivated me.

00:24:53.501 --> 00:24:54.060
Amazing.

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.021
Teach us.

00:24:55.221 --> 00:24:56.261
Please.

00:24:56.501 --> 00:24:58.620
Hexu, stepmother is truly impressive!

00:24:58.941 --> 00:25:00.981
Her skill is simply divine!

00:25:04.421 --> 00:25:06.140
She stands out among us.

00:25:06.501 --> 00:25:07.100
I bet

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.421
she's just showing off.

00:25:08.501 --> 00:25:09.140
Exactly.

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.181
I've always disliked the Xue family.

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.661
They flaunt their lord status,

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:14.981
constantly overshadowing us.

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.181
Madam...

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:29.620
Visit me

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:30.741
and we'll chat then.

00:25:31.221 --> 00:25:31.860
Mrs. Xue.

00:25:33.901 --> 00:25:35.741
This is Treasure Pavilion's new rouge,

00:25:35.941 --> 00:25:36.860
good for your skin.

00:25:37.421 --> 00:25:38.261
Consider it a gift

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:39.661
for our first meeting.

00:25:41.501 --> 00:25:42.580
Thank you, Mrs. Han.

00:25:43.901 --> 00:25:45.221
Don't be, Mrs. Xue.

00:25:47.981 --> 00:25:49.620
(Do you think I can't tell)

00:25:49.741 --> 00:25:51.261
(it's Disfigured Powder?)

00:25:51.421 --> 00:25:51.941
Madam.

00:25:52.181 --> 00:25:53.701
The rouge contains Disfigured Powder!

00:25:54.021 --> 00:25:54.901
Once applied,

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:56.741
it will disfigure her face soon.

00:25:56.901 --> 00:25:58.060
Let's see what she'd do then.

00:26:11.181 --> 00:26:11.820
Mother.

00:26:12.741 --> 00:26:13.421
My face.

00:26:13.661 --> 00:26:14.340
My child.
