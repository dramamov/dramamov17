00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.660
You are a demon?

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.620
I am actually a demon?

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.420
So Lord Wing is the real demon.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.660
(Why am I fine?)

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.699
(I actually forgot,)

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.620
(now I only have a broken soul.)

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.459
(Of course, there won't be a demon form.)

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.379
Look.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.099
Lord Wing is covered in feathers.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.339
So terrifying!

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.499
Lord Wing is really a demon.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.860
Disgusting!

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.499
I'm not a demon.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.499
No wonder he's called Lord Wing.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.860
Turns out he's a bird.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.300
I'm not a demon.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.940
I'm not a demon.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.459
I'm not a demon.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.740
I'm not!

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.500
I'm not a demon!

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.259
Demons should be wiped out completely.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.739
Yes, kill this demon.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.499
Kill him!

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.699
Kill him!

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.019
I'm not a demon!

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.619
Kill him!

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.779
Kill him!

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.020
Kill him!

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.139
Your Majesty.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.500
He is a demon.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.499
You all saw it.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.619
Saw it.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.179
No good demon exists.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.419
Kill him!

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.580
Your Majesty.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.179
Your Majesty.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.699
This demon can heal itself.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.859
We must extract its inner core

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.620
to completely kill it.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.740
You are right.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.340
Your Majesty.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.219
Your Majesty.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.780
Anyone who saw my brother as a demon

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.860
must die.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.020
Your Majesty.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.620
For our marriage,

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.100
I will give you a proper burial.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.899
(The revenge is not done.)

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.420
(I can't just die like this.)

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.779
Your Majesty,
don't kill innocents because of me.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.459
I am only protecting you.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.579
(I must survive first.)

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.860
Your Majesty.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.019
(Now I only have four uses
of my magic left.)

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.059
(It shouldn't be wasted on others.)

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.539
(But to survive,)

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.900
(I have no choice.)

00:02:40.262 --> 00:02:43.099
(Xiling Heng's Heart Chamber)

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.140
(This is Xiling Heng's heart.)

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.460
No choice.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.420
You'll have to fall in love
with me first.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.500
Charm Spell.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.540
Activate.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:17.940
Your Majesty.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.420
For our marriage,

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.100
Your Majesty orders me to die.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.300
Of course I will obey.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.660
If I can hug Your Majesty
one last time before dying,

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.700
I will be content.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.220
Your Highness.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.660
It's all my fault.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.100
You don't need to blame yourself.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.300
Lord Wing.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.979
Today you offended the Empress first

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.539
which caused all this trouble.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.819
If I hadn't handled it in time,

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.420
imagine the chaos.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.740
Your Majesty.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.139
As for Lord Wing,

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.300
I will not reveal it.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.620
Good.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.740
You are my Empress.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.700
How could I ever kill you?

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.859
Caught a cold, huh?

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.580
Go rest quickly.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.420
I take my leave.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.020
Your Majesty.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.100
Have you always known I'm a demon?

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.500
This was left by Father,

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.340
The Demon-locking Rope.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.300
Once it senses demonic power,

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.820
it will lock the demon firmly.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.300
Now you understand

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.419
why I always brought you

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.700
before the Three Pure Furnace
for a ritual?

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.300
Because

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.940
I am a demon.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.460
I am eliminating the demon nature.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.660
Your innate demonic power

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.980
always causes you to kill
while unconscious.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.060
No wonder sometimes when I wake up,

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.500
I find myself in unfamiliar places.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.460
I thought I was sleepwalking.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.860
I didn't expect this.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.139
But why have I lost
even my childhood memories?

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.020
Because back then,

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.020
you were a completely ruthless demon.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.700
I am a demon.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.420
Yet I have always...

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.940
I have always been killing my own kind.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.099
I am truly a beast.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.220
No.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.460
Brother,

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.939
you should be slaying demons.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.660
Because demons are evil.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.100
By killing demons,
you are absolving your own sins.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.179
Really?

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.500
Yes, really.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.540
My dear brother,

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.300
once the Three Pure Furnace completely
purifies your demonic nature,

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.820
you will become a normal human.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:25.940
Good.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.420
Brother,

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.300
you must endure.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.660
I am doing this all for your sake.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.539
Your Mother is a demon,

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.940
so you were born with inherent sins.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.660
But the human world
cannot tolerate demons.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:50.700
Before his death, Father instructed me
to protect you for life.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.539
Do you know how many people
I've killed for you all these years?

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.020
How much sin I've borne?

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.820
It's all for you.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:00.419
I'm sorry.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.540
Your Majesty.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.139
It's about to begin.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.700
You must endure.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.060
Endure it.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.140
Not enough yet.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.340
Hold on.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.540
Still not enough.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.540
Your Majesty.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:36.739
I'm sorry.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.180
Your Majesty.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.020
Still not enough.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.420
It's okay.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.820
I have forgiven you.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.140
(What is this feeling?)

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.740
(It must be because my soul
is unstable.)

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.540
(I must hurry.)

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.500
(He is a demon.)

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.219
(Since ordinary methods can't kill him,)

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.820
(I will extract his inner core.)

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.220
(This smell...)

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.020
(It's Xiling Xuan's.)

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:42.940
(He should be there.)

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.540
Xiling Xuan is indeed here.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.700
Hey!

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.060
Hey!

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.580
You really fainted.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.179
Heaven is helping me.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.100
Now I'll extract your inner core.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.819
(Demon-locking Rope?)

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.340
(Oh no.)

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.920
So you really are a fox demon.
