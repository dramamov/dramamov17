00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.500
Why is she still bleeding?

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.100
(I have self-regeneration.)

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.300
(Maybe my blood can help her.)

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.819
Your Lordship.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.020
What are you doing?

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.900
Your Lordship.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.220
Her wound is healing!

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.980
It really worked.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.539
So cold.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.300
Cold...

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.260
So cold...

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.100
Cold...

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.780
Hot...

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.140
It's so hot...

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.700
Liusu,

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:41.979
go get a physician, now!

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.100
Yes, Your Lordship.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.659
Yaya.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.100
Why do you look so down today?

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.420
Yue, I'm leaving Mount Yao.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.179
My father has come to take me home.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.179
He is waiting for me
at the foot of the mountain.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.179
Then, go on.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.100
Don't keep them waiting.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.379
But once I leave,

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.260
I might not see you again
for a very long time.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.620
Really?

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.699
Yue.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.579
Come with me.
We'll leave Mount Yao together.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.379
I heard the world outside is huge.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.900
It's full of amazing things.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.339
No, I can't.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.299
I'm the Fox Demon Saintess of Mount Yao.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.820
I can't leave this place.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.700
But I don't want to leave you.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.699
Crybaby bird.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.779
Go on, hurry.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.340
You can come visit me
when you have time.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.260
Go now.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.979
Go.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.900
Don't keep them waiting.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.859
Tushan Yue!

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:02.819
When I grow up,

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.860
I'll come back and marry you!

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.819
Silly boy.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.259
We'll see when you grow up.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.700
Now go, go on!

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.140
Don't go...

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.700
Don't go...

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.300
I never left.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.100
I've been here all along.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.300
Strange.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.340
How can one person have two pulses?

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.539
One is so faint, it's almost gone,

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.300
like the walking dead.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.859
The other still shows a hint of life,

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.180
but only the last of her three souls
and seven spirits remains.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.179
Her yin and yang are in chaos.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.580
I'm afraid

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.540
there's little hope left.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.260
Is there any other way to save her?

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.860
It will take a miracle.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.379
Her yang energy is floating
on the surface,

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.180
and her yin energy has
collapsed within.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.739
She must be placed
by a spring under the moonlight,

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.779
then fed with the Pure Yin Blood,

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.500
to balance yin and yang.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.939
But the problem is,

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.100
where can one possibly
find such blood now?

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.380
What is the Pure Yin Blood?

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.180
The heart's blood of a demon.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.540
I'm sorry, I can do no more.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:52.980
I'll take my leave.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.019
Cold.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.780
So cold.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.580
Hold on.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.100
Just hang in there a little longer.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.940
I missed you so much.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.300
Yaya.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.979
Yaya.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:40.819
Wake up.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.980
The sun's already up, Yaya.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.780
Yaya.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.099

it's my favorite.

Yaya.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.580
Yaya, look! We're flying so high.

Yaya.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.340
Yaya, you're such a crybaby bird.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.500
Yaya.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.459
So your name is Yaya.
