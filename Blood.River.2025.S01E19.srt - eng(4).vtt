00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.130
So this is a pharmacy too?

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.210
Which master is in charge here?

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.660
Me.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.540
Who is she?

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.770
You?

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.390
Young lady,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.100
get inside and help your master grind the herbs.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.290
Stop making trouble out here.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.540
May I ask, sir,

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.180
if your Fengmen point aches faintly

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.740
around 3 to 5 a.m. each day?

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.220
How did you know?

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.570
It must be from hard labor

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.690
when I was young,

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.060
so now I suffer.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.220
That makes sense.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.610
Then why does your Baihui point

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.170
throb without stopping

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.780
from 9 to 11 p.m.?

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.820
You did farm work back then,

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:22.610
but surely

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.260
you didn't damage your head doing it.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.610
Hey...

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.130
If you leave this untreated,

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.010
I'm afraid

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.380
you'll be meeting the King of Hell.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:30.690
Every word is spot-on!

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.890
Spot-on!

This physician is amazing!

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.170
You're a real miracle physician!

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.340
I've sought help for years,

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.450
spent so much time and effort,

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.610
all to cure

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.660
this body of mine.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:40.450
But,

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.820
though I've had plenty of prescriptions,

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.340
nothing has helped.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:44.730
Miracle physician, save me!

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.340
Please, save me!

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.450
You said you did manual work

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.450
when you were young.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.820
After that,

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.890
did you rinse off?

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.450
Of course.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.330
The well water there

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.340
is ice-cool.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.690
After the heavy work,

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.890
I'd pour it over my head.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.060
That felt great.

but you hurt your insides.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.500
I'll write you a prescription.

When you get home,

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.410
take it for forty-nine days,

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.500

How's that comparable?

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:45.170
Would a sword deity

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.850
use his blade to slice watermelon?

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:53.410
I'll go cook for you.

I've made a decision.

I'm taking a long trip.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:11.220
Some things

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.890
need to be settled.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:14.610
If not,

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.700
they'll be a knot in the heart.

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:18.730
Even if

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.340
you're happy

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.250

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:25.900

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:30.930
Go!

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:32.730
As long as

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.460
you don't risk your life,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:35.580
it's fine.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:37.850
Thank you.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:40.250
Since I've learned the hidden past,

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.300
I should do something for my family.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:49.850
Yours isn't a killer's sword.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.460
It's a sword that seeks justice.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.100
Think it through.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:57.220
From now on, be a swordsman,

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:58.820
not a killer.

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:00.180
At least...

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:02.890
for the time being,

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:05.580
I want a new role

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:07.610
to seek an answer.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.060
What role?

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:11.530
Young master

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.300
of No-Sword City.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.250
And what answer?

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.700
Wushuang City is peerless under heaven.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:20.980
But in the Way of the Sword,

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:22.940
it can't claim "peerless"

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:24.940
before No-Sword City.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:27.980
I see.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:29.650
You want to...

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:32.250
challenge

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:34.180
Wushuang City!

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.670
[Song Yanhui of Wushuang City]

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:50.250
Yushu.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.490
Are seeds really that tasty?

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.340
Master,

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.580
is sword practice that fun?

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:00.890
Sword practice isn't fun.

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:03.340
But I've trained since I was little.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.120
If one day

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.180
I'm not allowed to train,

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.130
I'll feel

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.340
life has no meaning.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:12.980
Master,

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.580
when will you start teaching me?

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.250
You're dropping the seeds?

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:23.300
No rush.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.010
You're born gifted.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:26.580
Every bit of carving

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.250
is critical.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:34.650
My master once told me,

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.490
I was born for the sword.

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:39.340
I've trained hard for decades,

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:41.010
yet...

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:44.650
Li Hanyi, who came after me,

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.820
has become the Xueyue Sword Deity,

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.300
while I'm still stuck.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:51.650
I'm running out of time.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:52.820
Master,

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.490
you come to the lake every day

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:57.460
but do nothing.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.220
Is there

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.980
some treasure in the lake?

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.250
Yes.

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:13.300
Master,

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:14.580
what's this?

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:16.890
This is the most precious treasure

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.060
of our Wushuang City,

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.340
the Peerless Sword Coffer.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:22.100
Inside this case

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.220
are thirteen famed swords.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.700
One is called Daming Vermilion Bird.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.300
In the Register of Famous Swords,

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:29.460
it ranks second.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.180
If it's "peerless",

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:32.610
why isn't it first?

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:35.300
First is the Emperor's sword.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.890
Daming Vermilion Bird is the martial world's sword,

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.130
so it dares to claim "peerless".

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:08.420
Master.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.770
Master,

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.300
where's the sword?

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.180
So it is.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.460
I've trained for thirty years.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:24.100
Today,

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.010
I tried opening it for the first time.

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.460
But in the end,

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:30.420
I wasn't the one it chose.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.290
Heaven wills it.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.100
Can't we

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.420
just open the coffer?

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.220
The coffer has a spirit.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.670
Only when it meets the one it accepts

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:43.850
will it open and yield a blade.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:47.530
Let me try.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.420
But you've never trained with a sword.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:56.850
Precisely because I haven't.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.010
Maybe this coffer

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.340
likes a blank slate.

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:03.700
All right.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:30.890
Master,

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.340
this sword...

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.130
is so beautiful!

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:36.340
This is the Peerless Coffer's

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.220
fabled Jade Ruyi.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:40.460
Master,

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:42.220
just now, the coffer

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.700
really opened for me!

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.010
Yushu.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:54.850
Yushu!

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:08.420
Seems at the end,

[Liu Yunqi of Wushuang City]

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.130
Wushuang City

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.340
can still be peerless.

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.650
Master.

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:39.770
Master.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.410
Did the coffer open earlier?

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.690
Was it me who opened it?

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.370
Let me tell you a story.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:52.250
Come.

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:57.100
When I was young,

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:58.490
I once loosed a sword strike.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:14:59.850
That stroke

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:01.580
pierced the clouds

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.490
and burned red like dusk.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.250
Even the southbound swallows

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.770
turned to look back.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.770
After that,

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:12.610
my master

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:13.820
changed my name

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:15.850
to Song Yanhui.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:18.890
Today,

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.730
I'll give you a new name too, okay?

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:22.700
Master.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:24.420
What will you name me?

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:26.610
From now on,

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.730
you'll be called Wushuang.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:30.130
Wushuang?

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.370
What about my surname?

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.340
No need for one.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:34.850
Just Wushuang.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.420
Hereafter when people think of the Peerless Coffer,

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:40.770
and speak of Wushuang City,

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:42.650
it will be because of you.

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:43.850
Because

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.250
you are Wushuang.

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:48.370
I believe in you.

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:50.850
You will achieve

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.340
what I could not.

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:54.650
All right.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:55.370
Master.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:56.820
I'll be Wushuang from now on!

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:57.700
Good.

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:02.770
I won't be gone long.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:04.580
I'll be back soon.

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:07.250
You made so much food.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:09.730
I really can't take it on the road.

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:14.180
Then leave the pastries

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.060
to me.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.180
I'll take care of them.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.130
I'd go with you,

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:23.220
but,

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:24.370
since you want to play

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.340
No-Sword City's young master for a while,

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.530
my identity at your side

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.610
would spoil the scene.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.180
If he can't carry,

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.370
I'll handle.

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:33.940
Like you'd get the chance!

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:44.940
What's this?

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.590
I sent people to fetch it

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:01.990
from Villa of Famed Swords.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.660
If you're challenging Wushuang City,

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.250
you'll need a fine blade.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.090
She's right.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:09.900
To keep your cover,

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.420
you can't use your umbrella sword,

00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:13.090
nor a cheap iron one

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.900
you can buy anywhere.

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:19.620
This blade is called Crane Feather.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.330
Crane as in white crane.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.460
Feather as in plume.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.140
Win at Wushuang City with it,

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:27.620
and your name will spread.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.090
Consider it

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.900
as also making a name for me.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:45.010
This must be pricey, right?

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:46.620
You bet.

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:48.620
It cost our clinic

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:50.050
three months' earnings.

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:54.490
This pricey gift

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:56.620
truly says a lot about your feelings.

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:06.490
Not bad.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:08.290
I've got great taste.

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:10.140
A fine sword

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:11.420
and a beauty,

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.940
what a pair!

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:19.090
Besides,

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:20.290
one more item for you.

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:30.180
What's this?

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.940
It's my little pet.

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:34.050
Lend it to you for protection.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.940
Take good care of it.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:39.940
All right.

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:41.940
I won't let you down.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.660
Looking at you now,

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.420
you do seem a roaming hero!

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:51.090
Maybe

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:53.420
he was meant to be one.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.660
He's leaving.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.290
So shouldn't you

00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.140
head home too?

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:01.980
You're kicking me out already?

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:04.980
Well, it can't be helped.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.940
I do need to go.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.290
Those so-called "family" back in Blood River

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:09.490
are nothing compared to you.

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:11.660
They're not reliable at all.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.900
Enough talk.

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:15.810
While everyone's still here,

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:17.010
let's polish off these pastries

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.980
together.

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:19.530
You can't finish them anyway.

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:37.290
Stake more!

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:38.010
Rest easy.

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:39.700
You'll all come out ahead.

[Tianxia House]

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:48.770
Sir,

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:49.660
right this way.

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:51.110
Boy, take the horse.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:51.570
Coming!

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.220
This way, honored guest.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.570
Our Tianxia House

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.000
can't match the fame

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.010
of Thousand-Gold Tower in Tianqi City,

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:01.810
Beauty Manor in Sangu City,

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.590
or Xiaoyao City of Qingzhou's Hundred Cities.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.770
We rank last of the Four Great Casinos.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:07.670
Besides,

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.700
unlike the other three

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:10.860
that serve

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:12.770
nobles and merchants,

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:14.220
our Tianxia House

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.220
mostly hosts

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.620
folk of the martial world.

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:19.810
That's the biggest difference.

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:21.140
Because

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:23.330
behind Tianxia House

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:24.810
stands

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.290
the famed city of arms,

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.090
the peerless Wushuang City.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:34.140
Wushuang City...

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.380
You wish to reach Wushuang City?

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:38.380
Yes.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.770
But to enter,

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:42.700
you need a Wushuang Token.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:43.620
Right.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.180
Ten li from here,

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:47.380
there's only one road

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:49.730
with a dozen checkpoints.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:51.900
Each one checks your token

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.180
before you pass.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.420
But...

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.770
that token's hard to get.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.090
A friend said

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:01.570
there's a way here.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.490
Naturally.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.860
Name your price.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.250
This is Tianxia House.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:11.900
Nothing here

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:13.220
is sold.

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:14.860
Only...

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:18.570
gambled.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.180
You need to wager

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:22.090
something valuable you have.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.140
Win,

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.180
you take the token.

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:26.570
Lose,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.010
your stake stays behind.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:32.810
I'll bet.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:35.090
- Big! - Small!

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:36.400
Very well!

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:38.810
This way, sir.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:46.140
Here

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:48.250
is your table.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.490
I'm no gambler.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.460
But since I'm here,

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.140
I'll follow the house rules.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.290
I have a 1,000-tael note.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.980
Will that do?

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.050
As I said,

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.810
you must stake

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:07.980
something precious.

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:09.100
A banknote

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.290
plainly isn't it.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.490
What we want is...

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.050
that stuff.

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:21.530
Sorry.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:23.490
This sword

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:24.420
means a lot to me.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.420
I do have a Dragon's Tear Pearl.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:29.490
Would that count as rare?

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:31.700
Dragon's Tear Pearl...

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:32.810
It's said

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.810
this bead holds great power.

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:37.460
If one cultivates inner skill

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.940
wearing it day and night,

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:40.900
in half a year,

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.860
his body will undergo

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:44.810
marvelous changes.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.010
Good eye, sir.

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:48.290
It is a fine piece.

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:49.660
Worth the wager.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:50.980
How do you want to bet?

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.660
Tianxia House rules:

the guest decides.

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:06.530
We offer table games and beast bouts.

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:08.330
Which will you choose?

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:09.530
Are table games

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.090
the ones downstairs?

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:14.910
Yes.

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:18.620
Dominoes, Madiao Cards, Big/Small, and Cover-and-Guess.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.530
And beast bouts

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.770
are our house's

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:23.140
signature specialty:

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:25.900
cockfights, dogfights, cricketfights,

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.180
and horse, pigeon, and dog races.

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:29.660
Take your pick.

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:31.380
Do you offer spider fights?

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.330
Eight-eyed wolf spiders.

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:56.770
Well informed, sir.

00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:58.490
Then,

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.900
which one will you back?

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.420
Must I choose one from them?

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.620
Unless

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.530
there's another option.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:15.980
I have a spider too.

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.050
I'll pit it against both.

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:20.810
If it wins,

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:22.290
I win.

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:23.700
How about it?

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.140
Eight-eyed wolf spider

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:28.810
is no common spider.

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:31.010
Your box

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.770
is barely half the size

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:33.940
of a wolf spider's.

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:36.810
How can one beat two?

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:38.180
Sir,

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.290
aren't you overconfident?

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:42.810
Then let's try.

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:44.290
Settled.

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:09.090
Hey, out.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:13.530
What's this?

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:18.250
Go.

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:34.220
Oh...

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.090
This is a White-Ghost Spider!

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:41.980
The very one of legend

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.980
that can take on a hundred!

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.380
Then I won

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:03.810
the Wushuang Token, right?

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:09.040
You carry a peerless sword,

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:10.370
bear a Dragon's Tear Pearl,

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:11.780
and casually produce

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:13.350
a rare White-Ghost Spider.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.050
Your birth must be uncommon.

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:16.980
With such standing,

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:19.050
why come to my house

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.720

visiting here today?

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:33.220
I won.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:34.900
Give me the token.

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.660
I followed your rules,

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.900
so please

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.570
follow yours.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:45.860
Fine...

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:47.530
I'll take you to it.

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.770
Much obliged.

Master.

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:18.050
It's been ages

since anyone came in here.

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.810
I won at Tianxia House,

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:24.660
so I should get the token.

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:26.530
Yes.

The token is already yours.

But guests of your skill

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.490
are rare indeed.

to know you better.

Do those behind the wall

wish to know me too?

00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.490
As I expected,

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:01.620
you were really

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.220
extraordinary.

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:06.490
As I said,

What is it?

If someone stops you on the way,

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:31.660
just say

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:33.360
you ordered a Soul-Chasing Crossbow

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.700
from Yuexia Smithy in Wushuang City,

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:38.660
and you're here to pick it up.

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:40.330
Got it.

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.660
Poison on it.

What do you mean?

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.050
Planning a mutiny, are you?

I'm your Patriarch.

Careful.

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:25.770
He isn't poisoned.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.330
What about Yumo and Changli?

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.420
Those who back you

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:48.620
have all been poisoned

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.420
and are now confined.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.660
Su Luandan did this, didn't he?

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.140
I really underestimated him.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:07.810
Eat your fill!

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:08.530
Okay!

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.380
In this heat, watermelon hits the spot!

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:13.570
Come share some!

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:14.570
But we have to...

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:16.050
No one is coming.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.050
Get over here.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:17.620
Eat with us.

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:18.010
Quick!

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.250
Today, eat all you want.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.050
As much as you like, hear me?

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:40.380
Get me another slice.

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:41.090
So sweet.

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:43.940
Misters.

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:47.680
Misters!

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.190
This melon's really sweet!

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:49.660
Yeah.

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:51.090
Sure is!

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:52.460
This watermelon

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:53.570
was brought all the way

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:54.770
from Nan'an City.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:55.980
So,

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:56.980
eat up.

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:01.250
Halt!

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:05.420
Who are you?

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.660
Daring breach Wushuang City's checkpoint?

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:09.860
Apologies.

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:13.490
You looked too busy to notice me just now,

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:14.660
so I took the liberty.

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.420
I have a Wushuang Token.

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.570
[Wushuang]
I'm here

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:20.660
because I ordered a Soul-Chasing Crossbow

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:22.460
from Yuexia Smithy in Wushuang City.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.050
I came to pick it up.

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:25.420
Not right.

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:27.090
What's not right?

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.030
Show the token first,

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.610
then step forward.

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:32.010
As it stands,

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:33.530
you passed three horse-lengths

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:34.420
before showing the token.

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:36.010
Out of order.

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:45.490
My apologies.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.330
I'd like to pass now.

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:48.620
May I?

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:56.490
Can a dead man

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:57.940
still stand up?

00:31:58.510 --> 00:31:59.590
Can a tree made into a boat

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:00.770
be planted back?

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:03.120
Can rice boiled to porridge

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.460
turn back to fried rice?

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:05.840
- No! - No!

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:06.490
Exactly!

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:07.840
No good!

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:10.460
Then, mister,

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:12.220
how should it be?

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:14.620
These three horse-lengths,

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:16.570
one thousand taels each.

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:18.180
Three horse-lengths,

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:19.620
that's three thousand total.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.420
You're joking.

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:25.770
That Soul-Chasing Crossbow

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:27.860
isn't worth three thousand taels.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.090
Even if I need it,

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:31.250
I wouldn't make

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:32.490
such a losing deal.

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.290
Wushuang City's famous across the land.

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:37.290
It's surely not short of three thousand taels.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.330
Wushuang City isn't,

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:40.530
but I am!

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.250
Besides, you're veiled,

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:45.220
and won't even show your real face.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:46.460
How do I know

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.050
what intent hides under that veil?

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:51.140
Sorry.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.850
I've had a strange illness since childhood.

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:56.250
My face can't be in sunlight,

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:58.220
or it breaks out in red sores.

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:00.460
So I travel veiled.

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:02.140
Please understand.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:04.980
All right then.

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:06.250
Out of pity,

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:07.490
three hundred taels.

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:09.980
Not a coin less!

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:17.180
Hand it over!

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:18.660
Move along.

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:20.290
We've struck gold this time.

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:21.710
- Sure have, look at that. - Come on.

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:22.490
Split it with me.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:26.770
Wait!

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:37.530
What now?

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:39.900
You sighed just now.

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:41.700
What was that about?

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:43.840
I just felt sorry for you.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.250
Wushuang City, once No.1 under heaven,

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:49.700
sets up all these checkpoints

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:51.940
just to squeeze travelers.

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:53.730
I've long admired

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:54.770
Wushuang City's renown.

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:56.660
But this experience today

00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:58.860
really disappointed me.

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:02.010
"Once"?

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:02.980
Kid,

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.070
Wushuang City has always

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:06.210
been the top power.

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:07.900
Spouting nonsense here,

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:09.200
you're not afraid to die?

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.050
These days in the jianghu,

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:14.980
No.1 is Xueyue City.

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:16.780
That's not just

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:17.740
my opinion.

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:20.260
If you think Wushuang City is stronger,

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.090
then tell me,

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:24.740
who beat Ye Dingzhi by half a palm

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.010
and saved the realm?

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.740
Which of today's Five Sword Deities

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.610
is named after a city?

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:35.300
Who is the No.1 Spear Deity?

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.130
None of them hail from Wushuang City.

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:39.420
So why call Wushuang City No.1?

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:40.570
You brat...

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:44.460
Sitong,

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:46.420
return his banknote.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.690
Senior...

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:48.570
Return it!

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.170
But...

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:51.260
Here.

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.860
Take it!

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:55.980
You're right.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.100
Doing this is shameful.

00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:59.090
However,

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.820
you insulted Wushuang City.

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:03.980
I can't let it slide.

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.460
Dare face me in a bout?

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:08.820
From Tianxia House to here,

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:11.130
Wushuang City has let me down.

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:13.860
So much I'd rather leave now.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.740
Looks like without a lesson,

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.490
you'll never learn!

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:37.740
Heavenly Pass Spear!

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.980
Senior, no!

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.340
If someone dies here,

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:40.780
we'll also...
