00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.520
(This is a work of fiction)

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.880
You mean...

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.439
you're stuck in this loop...

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.440
because of me?

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.720
Of course.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.360
Let me tell you.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.360
From now on,

00:01:11.361 --> 00:01:12.439
everything we do...

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.719
must be aimed at passing the level...

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.800
to keep me safe from this disaster.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.680
Wake up.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.880
Yes!

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.720
We finally passed.

00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:14.800
I told you this level isn't that hard.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.120
It's so easy.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.960
Work is so tiring.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.880
Then don't go to work tomorrow.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.200
Go to work for me then.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.640
I'll go to work for you.

00:02:35.641 --> 00:02:36.920
I can't let my baby get tired.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.280
Okay.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.000
Do my job for me,

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.800
and I'll do your job for you.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.160
What does this mean?

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.880
I'm not really going to do your job for you, right?

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.640
We've been stuck on the same day.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.080
Why not?

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.720
I'm not going to do your lousy job.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.920
What can you do to me?

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.160
I'm not going.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.560
Chen Jia Wen.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.680
What took you so long? Let's have a meeting.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.920
Who are you?

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.600
I mean,

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.560
who am I?

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.040
Chen Jia Wen, have you gone crazy?

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.080
Can you do your job or not? If not, get lost!

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.280
Let me see that.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.080
What are you doing?

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.000
Where are you going?

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.520
Hey.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.840
When did this happen?

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.160
About a month or so.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.960
You lost your job?

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.319
Why are you running errands?

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.320
(Errand King)

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.039
Don't look down on it.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.040
It pays well.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.080
When are you going to tell me?

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.600
I wasn't going to tell you.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.480
Fine. I don't want to fight with you.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.920
What should we do next?

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.880
Let's do it the way we passed the last level.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.839
Do my job for a day,

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.600
and I'll do your job for a day.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.800
It's that simple.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.400
Simple?

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.880
Can you be a live streamer?

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.400
Can you be an errand runner?

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.560
- Nine, - Nine,

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.560
- eight, - eight,

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.560
- seven, - seven,

00:05:30.561 --> 00:05:31.920
- six, five, - six, five,

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.720
- four, three, - four, three,

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.200
- two, - two,

00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:36.920
- one. We're live. - one. We're live.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.640
- Speak. - Speak.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.440
(Strawberry Flavor Puff)

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.440
Stop the live stream, quickly.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.280
What are you doing?

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.000
I'm asking you, what are you doing?

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.519
I told you to do a live stream, and you're eating here?

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.280
What is your mouth for? Are you stupid?

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.560
This is for humans.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.560
Is it for you to eat?

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.400
This is for humans.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.880
Who are you calling not human?

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.920
Can you do your job or not? If not, get lost!

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.160
Okay. Do my job...

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.416
- for me. - Is it easy to be a live streamer?

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.000
You can ask me anything you don't know.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.160
How hard can it be to talk and sell goods?

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.480
Move.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.280
How are you doing with driving the electric scooter?

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.440
I'm learning it.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.840
Anyway, I have plenty of time.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.200
Good luck then.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.560
Ask me any time if there's anything you don't know.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.120
Drive safely.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.599
- Ten, nine, - It's just chatting.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.976
- How hard can it be to sell goods? - eight,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.959
- It's just selling, doing sales. - seven, six,

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.216
- It's like being a broker. - five,

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.959
- Come on. - four, three,

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.239
- two, - Guys, sorry to keep you waiting.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.919
- one. We're live. - Welcome to our live stream. Today,

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.800
the first product we're promoting is...

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.079
Guys, sorry to keep you waiting.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.920
I'm your live streamer today. Yes.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.399
Today, the first product...

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.240
we're promoting is...

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.519
A1V1 mineral water.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.479
(Sanju Cafe)

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.480
Please wait a moment.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.240
Takeout for 0840.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.680
Please wait a moment.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.560
You might have given me the wrong one.

00:08:19.561 --> 00:08:20.721
There should only be one cup.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.240
The extra one is for you.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.120
You can even recognize me dressed like this?

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.640
I don't think...

00:08:29.641 --> 00:08:31.000
we know each other.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.040
But...

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.880
I do have something to tell you.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.639
Save it first. I'm really in a hurry.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.640
Let's talk next time.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.440
Can you pour it in a cool manner?

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.800
Dude, this is...

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.759
When we go out, we usually pour alcohol in a cool manner.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.079
No one pours plain water in a cool manner.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.239
Because if you do,

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.559
all your buddies will...

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.560
look down on you, right?

00:08:54.561 --> 00:08:55.839
So next time,

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.480
when we sell alcohol here,

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.560
we'll do that, okay?

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:20.920
No.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.640
How much is the alcohol content of this product?

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.120
How much...

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.239
Let me emphasize.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.080
The product we're selling today...

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.360
is mineral water.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.080
Another person asked,

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.719
is this product...

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.559
the strong aromatic type or savory type?

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.560
I...

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.360
So stubborn.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.120
So obstinate...

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.880
Here...

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.360
I'm sorry...

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.520
I'm sorry...

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.399
My scooter ran out of battery, so I pushed it all the way here.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.400
Is that so? I thought you got into an accident.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.680
I'm sorry...

00:10:08.681 --> 00:10:10.479
I have a new one over there. I'll exchange that now, okay?

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.520
No.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.120
Who knows if you spat in it?

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.480
Hello, Customer Service?

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.320
I want to file a complaint.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.656
Why did you hire such an idiot to deliver takeout?

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.399
She took a long time and even spilled it.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.600
I'd like to lodge a complaint.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.680
Go ahead.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.480
Why would the police arrest you for drinking water?

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.560
You can even fly a plane.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.920
What does it have to do with drinking this water?

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:44.960
You even have a headache?

00:10:44.961 --> 00:10:47.041
Have you ever had a headache for not drinking water?

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.680
You'd just go to the restroom, right?

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.080
Is the live streamer a man or a woman?

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.439
Can't you tell if I'm a man or a woman?

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.720
Did I train my body for nothing?

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.760
You can't tell if I'm a man or a woman?

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.040
Work is so tiring.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.600
Then don't go to work tomorrow.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.440
Go to work for me then.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.560
I'll go to work for you.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.520
I can't let my baby get tired.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.120
Okay. Do my job for me,

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.960
and I'll do your job for you.
