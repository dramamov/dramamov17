00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.319
Bai Family

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.280
Here, the mountains are high and
the emperor is far away.

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:08.120
If I kill you and toss you in the ravine,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.200
who could do anything to me?

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.000
Do it.

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:10.519
You.

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:12.200
Spirits create all things, guided by the underworld.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.280
With my command, wandering souls appear.

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:14.280
Reveal yourselves at once.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.040
Defy me, and you enter the realm of the dead.

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:25.319
Don't look.

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:34.439
Why are you running?

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.000
Who?

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:43.239
The person you killed—who was it?

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:49.280
No one.

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:59.879
My ancestor!

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.760
Hero!

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.879
Help me, please!

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.919
A life for a life.

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:17.360
Give me back my life!

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.439
I can't help with that.

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:24.840
You should ask her.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.400
I was just following orders too.

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.479
I wasn't the only one involved.

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:32.080
Those cowards who ran did it too.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.879
What are you doing?

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.919
What are you doing?

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.919
How did he wake up?

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.919
Quick, quick—give him the medicine!

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.680
Hurry, give him some medicine.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.960
This is the Yellow Immortal Temple.

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:30.599
You all—

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:31.879
I told you to let me go—let me out!

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.680
You won't have a good life either.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.240
You were pretending to be the Immortal Huang Xian.

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:35.560
Help!

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:36.479
Help!

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.319
No, no!

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.120
There is no Immortal Huang Xian at all.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.199
I'm going to report this to the authorities.

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:45.439
Go ahead, report it.

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:08.280
He's not breathing.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.680
What do we do now?

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.399
Great Immortal—

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.879
I don't know why,

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:46.800
he suddenly woke up.

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:49.680
Maybe the medicine wasn't strong enough.

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:54.680
That's because your heart isn't sincere.

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:56.000
I...

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.800
I even killed someone.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.519
Great Immortal, you—

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.240
You have to help me.

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:06.000
Help you?

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.639
That depends—

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.160
on how sincere you are.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.639
Great Immortal—

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:32.480
I was just following orders too.

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:33.399
Hero!

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:35.439
I know I was wrong.

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:39.319
I know I was wrong.

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:43.480
Villagers,

00:05:44.079 --> 00:05:45.439
everything you've seen

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.839
was arranged by this village chief

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.600
and his men.

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:51.199
They spread rumors to cause panic

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.120
just to satisfy their own selfish desires.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.959
There's one thing I don't get—

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:56.639
You're already the village chief,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.800
why go to all this trouble?

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.360
You ordinary people

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.240
only see trivial matters before you.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.600
But me—

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:08.759
I am destined to become an immortal.

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:09.720
You?

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:10.680
Become immortal? Become immortal?

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:11.439
Beast!

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:13.639
Who told you all this?

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:16.759
I'm asking you—who told you?

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:17.800
Speak!

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:19.240
Move aside! Move aside!

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.439
Hit him! Hit him!

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.279
Beat him!

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.879
Where's that little immortal from before?

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.240
Right ahead—over there!

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:44.720
Men and women shouldn't touch—I'm telling you!

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:46.560
How do you know the chief did the killing?

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:48.959
Can you really see ghosts?

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:50.560
No—who are you?

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:52.560
There are no ghosts in this world.

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:56.279
Look again, carefully.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.480
You really don't remember me?

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.519
Did you fall for someone else?

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:00.240
Calm down.

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:01.800
Calm down.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.160
You're a young lady—

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:07.040
It's dangerous to use knives and guns.

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:08.399
Isn't it?

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.680
I just noticed clues on the body

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.680
and deduced who was using the Immortal Huang Xian for evil.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.720
People like the chief, with a guilty conscience—

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.600
I hypnotized him with a bell,

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.519
and he confessed everything himself.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.439
Besides,

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.000
we've only just met.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.759
Why talk about liking each other?

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:23.240
I...

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.600
Wait a moment.

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:31.560
Then take a good look at this.

00:07:39.079 --> 00:07:40.519
Laifu, don't make a sound.

00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:43.040
Don't make a sound, no matter what.

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:13.720
What?

00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:14.959
You want it?

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:17.560
If you want it, come with me.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:19.680
Say it.

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:21.160
Where are we going with you?

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.279
Harbin.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.000
Harbin.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.759
Brother Laifu,

00:08:32.639 --> 00:08:33.679
your great kindness—

00:08:33.879 --> 00:08:34.919
I can't thank you enough.

00:08:35.759 --> 00:08:36.360
Don't worry about it.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:36.840
I am willing—

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:37.559
It's really nothing.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:38.600
I'm willing to give myself to you.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.519
I said it's nothing.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.080
Give yourself to him?

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.039
Miss,

00:08:44.279 --> 00:08:45.960
Young ladies shouldn't say things like that.

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:47.279
It sounds terrible if word gets out.

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:48.360
Isn't it? No, you—you—

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.480
Who are you? Yeah!

00:08:49.559 --> 00:08:49.960
You—

00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:51.080
Give what? Promise what?

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:51.600
Exactly.

00:08:51.679 --> 00:08:52.320
You can't marry him.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.039
He's my fiancé—it's not right.

00:08:53.039 --> 00:08:54.120
Did you hear? I'm her—

00:08:54.519 --> 00:08:55.559
fiancé.

00:08:58.759 --> 00:09:00.519
You promised to marry me when we grew up.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.320
We had a childhood engagement.

00:09:02.759 --> 00:09:04.240
I was so young, how could I remember?

00:09:07.639 --> 00:09:08.200
Forget it.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.240
I'll let you go for solving the case.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.200
Since you're in Harbin,

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.720
come with me to change your outfit.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.720
Would you like a pack of cigarettes, sir?

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.080
Welcome—please come inside.

00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:21.399
You two, feel free to look around.

00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:32.799
This one.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.600
Welcome to Da Shijie.

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:54.799
Bai Xiaojie, you've arrived.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:55.919
Xiao Mei.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:56.799
Alright.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.240
Sir, please come inside.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:00.720
Have a seat here.

00:11:04.799 --> 00:11:05.360
Here.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.279
Take good care of them.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:11.720
Your drink.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:12.639
Please enjoy.

00:11:12.879 --> 00:11:13.799
First time here?

00:11:15.039 --> 00:11:17.039
Shall I pour you a drink?

00:11:22.919 --> 00:11:23.639
Go ahead—no need.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:24.799
You may leave now.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.799
We still have things to discuss.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.759
Alright, Bai Xiaojie.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.799
Remember to find me next time.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.080
I've arrived in Harbin.

00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:43.039
Photo.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.679
You really are a country bumpkin.

00:11:46.919 --> 00:11:47.799
You're already here,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.039
still thinking about that photo.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.000
I don't want the photo.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.320
Why did I even come to Harbin?

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.080
You Harbin folks are so open-minded.

00:11:55.399 --> 00:11:57.240
First meeting, and you call someone fiancé.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.399
Even bring your fiancé to a place like this.

00:11:59.799 --> 00:12:02.080
This country bumpkin sure learned a lot.

00:12:04.159 --> 00:12:04.639
Alright.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:06.879
Then listen up.

00:12:08.799 --> 00:12:10.080
There's a folk legend—

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.360
A fox absorbs the energy of nature

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.679
to become a Fox Immortal.

00:12:14.279 --> 00:12:15.919
The Fox Immortal is skilled in enchantment.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.480
Most capable of beguiling the heart.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.519
The dancers here often worship the Fox Immortal.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.879
All to make guests fall head over heels.
