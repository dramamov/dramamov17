00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.439
You are about to meet His Majesty.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.840
Remember this.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.000
From now on,
you will be the closest person

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.119
to His Majesty.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.399
Attend to him meticulously.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.399
Understood.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.200
Where are you?

00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:10.840
You're here.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.840
Hurry up.

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:13.959
I got you.

00:01:14.519 --> 00:01:15.200
Over here.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.840
Come and catch me.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.920
Don't run.

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:19.959
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.959
Don't run.

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:26.519
I got you.

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:28.239
Your Majesty,

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.640
I've brought the newly selected

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:31.879
waiting maid.

00:01:44.397 --> 00:01:47.935
(Months earlier)

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.480
Master,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.239
what do you need?

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.760
During the Pingxiang rebellion,

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:02.640
the tyrant Emperor Shi Yu

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.760
took the throne
with Pingxiang's support,

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.520
and then betrayed his word
and slaughtered our people.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.560
Nowadays,

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.159
he wallows in corruption and debauchery.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.840
Kill him,

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.960
and the people
will be spared from suffering.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.319
It will also avenge
your deceased parents

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.879
and the people of Pingxiang.

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:21.560
Kill!

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.000
Kill them all.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.879
Leave none alive.

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:25.560
By His Majesty's decree,

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.680
the Pingxiang rebels

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.560
have committed capital offenses.

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:32.360
Regardless of age or gender,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.360
spare no one.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.240
No.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.639
No.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.520
(The palace is selecting
new waiting maids.)

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:00.240
(If chosen,)

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.800
(you'll become close to the Emperor.)

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.639
Waiting maids

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.360
need to assist His Majesty in dressing.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.199
(They must possess a subtle
and natural fragrance.)

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:13.240
(The first test)

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.960
(involves kids
with the keenest sense of smell)

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.560
(identifying scents.)

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:29.840
The second test.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.719
(Waiting maids)

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.599
(hold a position close to His Majesty.)

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:35.719
(To ensure his safety,)

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:37.639
(they must be free of ailments)

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.159
(or scars.)

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.000
(Therefore, to become a waiting maid,)

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.120
(no scars can remain.)

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.400
(You carry the vengeance
of Pingxiang's descendants.)

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.719
(Your family,)

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:50.800
(your parents,)

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:52.800
(and childhood companions)

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.800
(all perished
under that tyrant Emperor's)

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.400
(casual order.)

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.120
Everyone has been checked.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.439
The final test.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.879
(Only by becoming a waiting maid)

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:36.040
(will you get the best chance
to assassinate him.)

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:05.680
Stop.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.759
Good.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.720
Excellent.

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:15.639
What is your name?

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.480
Cheng Ge.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.839
Congratulations.

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.639
You are now His Majesty's waiting maid.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.519
Waiting maid?

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:31.480
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.480
As my waiting maid,

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:37.199
merely undressing me isn't enough.

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:39.439
You must know how to undress yourself.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.680
Take it off.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.600
Let me see.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.199
What?

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.360
You dare disobey my command?

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:54.839
Just as Master said,

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.759
he's utterly depraved.

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:04.319
Good!

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.639
Good!

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.639
Good!

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.480
- Take it off now!
- Take it off now!

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.959
Stop dawdling.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.720
(You will die tonight.)

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.879
What time is it?

00:07:00.519 --> 00:07:02.199
It's already midnight.

00:07:02.519 --> 00:07:04.279
Your Majesty, you should rest now.

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:05.920
Waiting maid.

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:08.360
It's time to dress His Majesty.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.560
The Prince Regent has arrived.

00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:53.120
Don't move.

00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:03.480
Lord Father,

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.160
why are you here?

00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:08.399
Your Majesty, if you have time
to favor a maid here,

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:10.480
you might as well

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.399
pay the Empress a visit.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.439
I drank too much today

00:08:15.079 --> 00:08:16.160
and feared disturbing her.

00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:19.199
I've heard that since you married
with my sister,

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.879
you've never touched her.

00:08:21.319 --> 00:08:21.800
What?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Do you look down on our Gao family?

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.600
I wouldn't dare.

00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:28.759
How would I forget

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.560
your kindness?

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:32.960
During Pingxiang rebellion,

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.960
had you not led troops to suppress it,

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.799
how could I get what I have today?

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.240
May I ask

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.840
why you visit

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:42.799
so late at night?

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:43.879
Your Majesty,

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.559
come with me to the courtyard.

00:09:10.519 --> 00:09:11.200
Your Majesty.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.279
Great!

00:09:34.679 --> 00:09:35.320
Lord Father,

00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:36.320
these...

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.039
These men are all

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.600
loyal court officials.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.600
Did something go wrong?

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.440
Your Majesty,
though you have come of age,

00:09:45.279 --> 00:09:48.080
you still can't distinguish
loyal officials from traitors.

00:09:48.519 --> 00:09:50.240
As your Lord Father,

00:09:50.919 --> 00:09:53.120
I've truly failed in my duties.

00:09:54.159 --> 00:09:54.759
Your Highness.

00:10:07.263 --> 00:10:10.752
(Assassinate the Prince Regent
at midnight tonight)

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:11.720
Your Majesty,

00:10:12.519 --> 00:10:13.320
these women

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.360
were carefully selected by me for you.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.600
Please check it out.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:25.840
Too many

00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:27.279
eavesdroppers.

00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:28.879
We have to wrong you for now.

00:10:33.639 --> 00:10:34.320
You

00:10:35.159 --> 00:10:36.639
are now the only ones I trust.

00:10:37.559 --> 00:10:39.480
This mission will be perilous.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:40.679
Your Majesty,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.120
haven't we waited

00:10:42.519 --> 00:10:43.639
all this time for today?

00:10:43.799 --> 00:10:44.279
Exactly.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.519
Right, Your Majesty.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.639
Your Majesty.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.799
These treacherous officials

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:55.240
share bathing pools with you every day.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.320
Yet they secretly plot

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.320
to assassinate me!

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:00.879
Your Majesty,

00:11:01.679 --> 00:11:04.080
isn't this inviting ridicule
from outsiders?

00:11:04.879 --> 00:11:06.120
Others might think

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.840
that you want to assassinate
your own Lord Father.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.399
Gao Ji!

00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:12.720
You vile schemer,

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.279
ruthless

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.480
and drunk on power!

00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:16.879
You're the one

00:11:16.879 --> 00:11:17.639
who deserves death!

00:11:22.879 --> 00:11:25.360
This traitor has deceived the throne.

00:11:26.639 --> 00:11:29.240
You should personally execute him.

00:11:29.759 --> 00:11:30.600
You brute!

00:11:31.159 --> 00:11:31.759
Today,

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.519
I'll kill you!

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.799
Assassinating a court official

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.080
deserves execution.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.080
Today's events...

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.279
Today's events

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.279
were all my doing!

00:11:58.559 --> 00:11:59.159
Gao Ji!

00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:01.960
I'll haunt you even in death!

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.279
Take care.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.519
May I ask how many family members
you have left?

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.519
Your Highness, please spare my family.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.279
Spare me, Your Highness!

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.000
The traitors are eliminated.

00:12:36.799 --> 00:12:37.360
Your Majesty,

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.519
you may now rest.

00:12:46.039 --> 00:12:46.799
Read.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.720
Shang Wen, Kong Wu, and Wen Zhong

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.480
attempted to assassinate
a court official.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.600
They are treacherous

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.639
and utterly unforgivable.

00:12:56.039 --> 00:12:57.600
His Majesty was decisive in killing,

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.240
stroke down traitors himself,
