(This is a work of fiction)

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.719
How can we pass this level?

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.320
Can't we switch to another one?

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.960
We need to really think this through.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.720
We can't keep working like this.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.640
Then tell me,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
how do we pass it?

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.520
Let me ask you,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.680
how many orders do you deliver daily?

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.120
It depends on my mood. Five orders.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.200
Five orders?

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.800
I deliver at least 50 orders a day.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.040
Wait.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.840
How many do you sell daily on your live stream?

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.920
The more, the better, of course.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.880
They require 1,000 orders from us.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.920
I get it.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.840
These are the conditions to pass.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.640
You...

00:01:52.641 --> 00:01:54.159
must deliver at least 50 orders daily,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.680
and I have to sell at least 1,000 orders daily...

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.880
to pass this level.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.480
What are you laughing at?

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.080
Fifty orders is definitely no problem for me.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.000
One thousand orders? You can't do it.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.640
Ms. Shen,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.239
after I sell 1,000 orders,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.320
I hope you won't hold me back.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.400
Thank you.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.440
Mr. Chen,

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.440
after I finish 50 orders,

00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:20.721
I hope you won't mess up either.

What kind of pot should you cook it in?

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.879
Actually, if you have an iron pot at home...

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.520
or a clay pot, they will do.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.039
This person is asking,

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.760
what if I don't have a pot at home?

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.080
You have a new order.

to me,

you've always been super cool.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Thank you.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.480
I'm sure you'll become...

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:35.760
the best live streamer in our company.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.760
By the way,

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.040
I need to ask you something.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.759
Every time I stream,

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.680
how do I deal with those annoying comments?

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.280
Actually, you don't have to deal with them.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.960
Every time I see those comments,

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.000
I just do what they say.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.440
I am...

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.880

Toughen up.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.160
That's why every time I watch your stream,

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.760
it feels so good to see you talk back to people.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.880
Seriously, Jia Wen,

00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:11.599
I think you're really cool.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.800
You're the kind of person I've always wanted to become.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.640
I'm all right.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.960
Jia Wen, I have to go.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.600
You can do it.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.960

All right, next, let us...

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.119
turn our attention to the people...

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.479
who have joined our live stream.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.160
What kind of interesting interactive comments have they sent me?

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.320
Someone asked,

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.400
can you pour it in a cool manner?

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.319
Of course. As a live streamer,

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.759
I will meet all customer needs.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.720
But I have a friendly reminder.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.479
- We must drink water... - Slowly!

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.480
That's right.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.599
Another person asked,

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.079
is this product the strong aromatic type...

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.600
or savory type?

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.400
Let me tell you. This high-quality product is...

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.759
- The sweet, fragrant type. - The sweet, fragrant type.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.599
That's right, it's a sweet, fragrant type...

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.239
of all-natural mineral water.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.960
It's very sweet and refreshing.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.880
I also saw someone ask,

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.360
can you drink a love shot?

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.919
Of course. I can fulfill all your needs.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.279
I'll randomly summon a colleague here...

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.560
to drink a love shot with me.

why you used to like this so much.

By the way,

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:20.920
I have a question for you.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.760
Does Yuan from your company...

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.800
like you?

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.520
He's always clinging to me.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.400
You're overthinking it.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.200
When you go back to work, be careful.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.600
He looks innocent, but he's faking it.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.840
Can he fake it as much as you?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
I don't get it either.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.480
Instead of doing your job,

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.319
you're out in the sun and wind every day.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.536
You're suffering for no reason.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.560
Why are you doing this?

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.800
To be honest with you,

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.199
when I was laid off,

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.760
I was so happy.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.559
You only have one Ms. Wang,

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.080
but I had a whole bunch of them.

I'm very curious. Don't you want to beat her up?

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.600
Do you want to?

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.080
Then do it.

for me to come back to life,

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.560
what would you do?

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.160
Then I'd have to kiss her.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.200
I must save you.

00:10:16.201 --> 00:10:17.881
Your life is more important than anything.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.920
Aren't you afraid I'd get mad?

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.600
At this point,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.200
would I still care about that?

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.320
Which ex-girlfriend would you kiss then?

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.640
If I were dying,

and you must kiss your ex-boyfriend,

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.280
what would you do then?

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.240
Don't change the subject.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.000
You're being unreasonable.
