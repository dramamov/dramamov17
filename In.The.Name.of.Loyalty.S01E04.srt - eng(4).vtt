00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:37.679
Your Grace.

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.200
Get up.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.560
At third quarter of the Hai hour,

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.119
His Majesty must wear
this set of garments.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.480
All maids in his chambers

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.680
are new recruits, aren't they?

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.640
Aren't you curious

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.519
about where they all went?

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.519
If they proved incompetent,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.640
my garden

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:32.599
would gain new fertilizer.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.799
Was the drug sufficient?

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.319
Rest assured, Your Grace.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.560
More than enough.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.960
Your Majesty, time to get changed.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.520
As you said,

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.199
these memorials

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:42.120
are usually reviewed
by the Prince Regent.

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:44.159
So what are you reading now?

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.400
Occasionally,

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:48.479
he sends some memorials he's reviewed

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:49.800
for me to read,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.919
making me understand state affairs.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.280
However,

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.280
what he permits me to see

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:56.560
is merely

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.360
what he wants me to see.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.159
Otherwise, I wouldn't have

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.599
known the truth
about Pingxiang only now.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.840
Let's go.

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:12.199
Get changed.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.960
Didn't I say I would
protect your identity?

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.240
This is just an act,

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:22.120
yet you refuse?

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.000
This garment

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:29.039
was sent by the Empress.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.280
I won't wear it.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.840
If you don't wear it,

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.560
she'll cause trouble for me.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.159
- Where are you going?
- To confront that madwoman Gao Zhiying.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.479
I found this garment

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:50.199
suspicious,

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:51.080
so I came to tell you.

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:53.479
What good intentions could she have?

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.120
If you find her directly,

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:57.639
won't that provoke her more?

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.439
I am the Emperor.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.879
Must I

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.039
now be deprived

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:04.240
of choosing my own garment?

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.000
Handle with care.

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:16.040
Be gentle.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.800
Your Grace.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.720
Where is His Majesty?

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.839
He said he was going to see you.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.959
He just left.

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:31.879
Could the drug

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:34.079
be taking effect?

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.959
Gao Zhiying.

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:42.399
Gao Zhiying!

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:45.399
Wouldn't you protect my identity?

00:04:46.079 --> 00:04:47.360
If she blames me for this,

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.720
how should I respond?

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.319
Don't you realize
what's on this garment?

00:04:58.839 --> 00:05:00.199
Gao Ji is dominating the court.

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:01.439
Now

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.120
I can't even control my own body.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.399
The Empress's scheme

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.360
is just to conceive a royal heir.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.639
But if the Gao family gets an heir,

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.480
the empire will be in chaos.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.839
Give it to me.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.240
What are you doing?

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:17.800
I won't involve you.

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:20.600
You...

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:23.399
Nor will I aid a tyrant.

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:25.079
You can't wear

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:26.600
this garment.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.199
Then tell me.

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:29.839
What should I do now?

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.839
- Greetings, Your Grace.
- Greetings, Your Grace.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.720
Have you seen His Majesty?

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:36.800
Give it to me.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.839
What are you doing?

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.680
Come help.

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:11.639
You,

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.360
lie down.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.959
What?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.680
Lie down now!

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.879
Wait.

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:18.120
What's this about?

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:18.839
When she wakes

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:20.399
and sees you tomorrow,

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.879
it will all be over.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.399
Wait!

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:28.519
You ask me to sleep with her all night?

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.439
She's unconscious.

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:31.639
What if she wakes at night?

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:32.480
She won't.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.839
No way. I want to go back.

00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:42.600
Oh, no.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:45.879
Yu,

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.759
last night, we...

00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:54.519
Why can't I remember clearly
what happened last night?

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:01.639
Someone!

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.320
Bring the waiting maid

00:09:03.799 --> 00:09:04.600
to dress me.

00:09:05.559 --> 00:09:07.399
Yu, why the hurry to dress?

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.399
You rarely visit my palace.

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:12.399
Don't you want to stay a little longer?

00:09:14.879 --> 00:09:17.279
I've done what you asked.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:18.720
From now on,

00:09:19.679 --> 00:09:21.080
don't meddle in palace affairs.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.840
Yu,

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.159
are you saying

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:41.440
last night, we truly...

00:09:46.159 --> 00:09:46.600
You.

00:09:47.159 --> 00:09:48.159
What are you doing there?

00:09:48.559 --> 00:09:49.919
These words aren't for your ears.

00:09:50.519 --> 00:09:52.679
