=Episode 7=

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.259
Why...

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.739
Why am I here in your bed?

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.100
Xiling Xuan.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.540
Old habits die hard, huh?

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.739
Your Majesty. Last night, I kept an eye
on this fox demon,

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.540
waiting for her remnant soul
to return to her body.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.060
Yet somehow,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.019
she suddenly turned into this state.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.899
Your Majesty.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.300
That's not the case, Your Majesty.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.019
Please hear me out, Your Majesty.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.900
Your Majesty.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.819
It's not the case.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:40.979
Yesterday, Xiling Xuan

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.579
went berserk and knocked me out,

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.779
dragging me to his bed.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.539
I never expected

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.579
he would covet my body.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.700
Nonsense!

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.099
Your Majesty.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.060
Don't listen to this wicked demon.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.939
She must be behind all this.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.099
Last night, I did...

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.260
Last night, he must've
done something to me!

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.579
Your Majesty.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.619
My whole body hurts right now.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.139
I can barely stand.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.980
Your Majesty, you must stand up for me.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.260
I'll kill you now!

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.260
Fine.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.540
If killing me

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.940
can make you feel better,

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.780
go ahead and do it.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.980
After all, I shouldn't exist in this world.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.780
Xiling Xuan.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.340
Do you think I can't do anything to you?

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.539
Is that why you dare
to be so presumptuous?

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.340
I would never do so.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.860
You covet my woman now.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.460
You might covet my throne after this.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.379
Why don't I just give you
my life as well?

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.459
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.580
Please don't!

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.060
Your Majesty.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.060
I can't live without you.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.460
Don't.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.100
Don't.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.780
Fine.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.580
I'll do as you say.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.860
Xin'er, don't worry.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.060
No one will find out

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.780
what happened today.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.339
Get rid of her.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.300
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.459
Your Majesty, have mercy!

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.619
No!

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.580
Your Majesty.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.779
She seems honest by nature.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.900
I'm sure she wouldn't dare spill it.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.139
Why not let her stay by my side

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.700
and let me train her?

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.460
Since the Empress has pleaded for you,

00:02:28.746 --> 00:02:30.306
I'll spare your life.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.939
From now on, serve the Empress well.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.260
If anything goes wrong,

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.900
I won't forgive you.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.779
Thank you, Your Majesty!

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.260
Thank you, Your Highness!

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.260
Xin'er.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.539
Let's go.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.660
Mm.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.500
Thank you
for saving my life, Your Highness.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.260
Who exactly are you?

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.660
Why did you save me last night?

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.259
Your Highness,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.980
here's the strong tea you asked for.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.539
(Darn it.)

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.260
(Looks like he doesn't plan to sleep.)

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.860
(What's it with him?)

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.180
(He's asleep.)

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.060
(A perfect chance.)

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.820
That's strange.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.619
He took the strong tea.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.740
How could he be sleeping like a log?

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.140
This isn't tea.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.580
It's Bewitching Powder.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.300
That's all I can do for you.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.940
I just hope that when the time comes,

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.620
you'll save my life in return.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.879
(Liusu, Palace Maid)
My name is Liusu.

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.040
My home is in the downtown
located in the east of the city.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.700
Due to yesterday's demon disaster,

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.260
my whole family was killed.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.939
It's all because of Xiling Xuan.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.659
If it weren't
for the calamity he caused,

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.540
they wouldn't have died at all.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.660
I understand the pain

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.380
of losing one's family.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.460
Please, get up and speak.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.379
No.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.699
I want revenge.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.139
But I'm just a mortal.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.339
You're different.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.580
You're a demon.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.260
I beg of you.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.660
Help me kill him!

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.860
Humans fear demons.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.100
Aren't you afraid of me?

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.939
There are good and bad people,

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.540
just as there are good and evil demons.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.779
I know you're not an evil one.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.660
So there's nothing to fear.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.100
Don't worry, Liusu.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.500
All evil demons will go to hell.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.140
I'll make sure Xiling Xuan

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.500
gets the punishment he deserves.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.180
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.260
Your Lordship.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.580
It was Hehuan Powder in this bowl.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:50.860
Are you sure?

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.059
I've been a physician for decades.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.700
There's no way
I'd mistake something like this.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.660
(This wretched demon.)

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.859
(She actually tried
to use Hehuan Powder on me)

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.739
(and make me commit
an act against morality)

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.180
(to disgrace the imperial court.)

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.379
(Heaven must have been watching.)

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.060
(She drank it herself,)

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.460
(resulting in her soul leaving her body.)

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.499
(I must find a way)

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.540
(to make His Majesty see it himself.)

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.860
Do exactly as I said

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.060
and she'll definitely reveal herself.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.059
In order to make the plan work,

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.299
make sure

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.660
she takes this Hehuan Powder
in front of His Majesty.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.380
Then His Majesty will believe me

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.500
and destroy that wicked demon.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.660
This plan will decide it all.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.300
Don't worry, Your Lordship.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.140
She hasn't suspected me at all.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.940
I'll complete the mission without fail.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.099
Your Highness.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.660
See? I told you my massage technique
is pretty good.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:58.980
Mm.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.419
I guess you're the most skilled one

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.019
in the whole harem, right?

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.339
Of course.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.219
If Your Highness likes it,

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.419
I can give you a massage every day.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.340
Good.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.379
Your Highness.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.460
I thought the acupoints of humans
and demons would be different.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:27.940
I didn't expect

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.860
they'd actually be the same.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.740
That's only natural.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.139
After all, you used to work for Lord Wing

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.539
and give him massages.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.499
Of course you'd find humans' acupoints

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.740
same as demons'.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.459
Your Highness.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.500
This is the calming tea I prepared.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:52.979
Having a cup of it before bed

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.980
will help you sleep better.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.260
Mm.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.460
Keep going.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.060
Oh, right.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.539
Well,

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.579
it was a severe disaster

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.100
that many victims
still haven't been relocated.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.900
I think it's going to rain outside.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.260
Why don't we go take a look?

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.379
Your body hasn't recovered yet,

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.300
so don't worry about others for now.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.219
Your Majesty.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.619
Why are you here?

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.660
Didn't you ask me to come here?

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:43.900
Me?

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.460
I didn't do so.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.419
I know we've been married for many days,

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.140
but we haven't consummated the marriage.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.700
Are you blaming me?

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.499
(This is bad.)

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.259
(The Charm Spell
I cast on his heart earlier)

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.780
(is showing its side effects.)

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.780
How could that be, Your Majesty?

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.379
You attend to state affairs
and work hard for the country every day.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.339
How could I dare to blame you?

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.900
I'm glad you don't blame me.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.980
I'll sleep here tonight.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.300
Well, Your Majesty...

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.660
I...

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.740
I haven't recovered from my cold.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:20.539
I'm afraid of infecting Your Majesty.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.140
That would be bad.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.579
We're one as husband and wife.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.900
What's there to fear?

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.940
That's right.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.979
We're one as husband and wife.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.660
In that case...

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.500
Let's have a cup of calming tea first.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.940
Liusu just reminded me
to drink it before bed.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.540
I'll pour it for you.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.660
(What do I do? I refuse to consummate
the marriage with him.)

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.179
Let me feed it to you.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.739
It's all right. I wouldn't trouble
Your Majesty with that.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.540
I can manage it.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.259
(Fox demon.)

00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:59.539
(After taking this Hehuan Powder,)

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.780
(you shall meet your demise tonight.)

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:08.980
Xin'er.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:15.460
Xin'er.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.660
Your Majesty...

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:19.860
Xin'er.
