=Keeping Up with Beauty=
(Adapted from "The Highborn Matron Reborn as the Pitiful Heiress")

=Episode 20=

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:02.880
Yunyun.

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.480
You're divorced.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.150
Why are you going back to the Gu family?

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.799
Gu Chenyu was poisoned,
and his eyes were injured.

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:09.719
I want to help him.

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:10.920
His eyes?

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.159
What do they have to do with you?

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.239
You are Nangong Yu, not Fu Yunyun.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.319
Your top priority
is to locate that jade pendant

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:18.439
and return to the past.

00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:21.319
He...

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.920
He was stabbed because of me.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.760
I don't want to owe him anything.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.719
Muyan.

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.000
Can you give me a little more time?

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.400
Do you think
I'm eager to send you back to the past

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.000
because I want to do so too?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.200
As long as I'm with you,

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.200
no matter which world it is,

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:48.760
I...

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.359
I'm sorry.

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:56.840
I'm sorry, Muyan.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.159
What's wrong, Mr. Gu?

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:48.439
Why did you fall down the stairs?

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.719
Has Mr. Gu really gone blind?

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:53.759
I thought it was fake.

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:54.759
It turns out to be real.

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:17.120
Let me help you down.

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.919
Hold on to me.

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:47.240
Careful.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.879
They should be here soon, right?

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:40.319
Well, maybe we shouldn't
be having this meal.

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:41.160
Yansheng.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.759
Didn't you promise to join this meal?

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:43.850
We're already sitting here.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.120
Chenyu, Yunyun.

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:49.680
Are you all right?

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.480
I'm fine.

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:53.920
Yansheng.

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:56.639
It's been so long
since our last meal together.

00:04:57.519 --> 00:04:59.000
Grandma is in the hospital.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.759
And Mom...

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:01.399
Careful.

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:03.959
There's only a few of us left
in this family.

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:06.759
Sit down.

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:07.360
Come on.

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:16.839
Yunyun is so good to Chenyu.

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:18.360
She does everything herself.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.370
They're just inseparable.

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:23.639
You won't be leaving again
now that you're back, right?

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:26.680
I haven't...

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.480
That's enough.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.360
Let's eat.

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:32.240
Then let's dig in.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.480
This braised beef
is your favorite, Chenyu.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.079
I specially had them prepare it.

00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:37.750
And the shrimp
is your favorite, Yansheng.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.800
Eat up.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.839
Let me do it.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.439
It's okay, I can manage it.

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:59.160
Leave it to me.

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:06.120
I'll do it.

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:13.720
Here.

00:06:14.079 --> 00:06:14.720
Open your mouth.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:16.480
It's your favorite braised beef.

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:18.560
Thank you.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.560
Yansheng.

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:43.680
Fu Yunyun's jade pendant...

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:45.759
Where could it be?

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.120
Could it be that there are

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:55.720
memories I haven't come across

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:58.480
here in this family?

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.160
Let go of me! I didn't do it!

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.879
Why don't you all believe me?

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:38.480
Let go of me! I didn't do that!

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:40.160
Let go of me!

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.160
What should I do?

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:28.079
It's that jade pendant.

00:08:29.319 --> 00:08:30.120
But

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.559
what happened after that?

00:08:48.639 --> 00:08:49.879
Who are

00:08:50.559 --> 00:08:51.639
you?

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.600
Someone help me...

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.399
Someone...

00:09:36.039 --> 00:09:36.919
I must live...

00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:41.039
I must live...

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.480
Someone

00:09:45.159 --> 00:09:46.159
help me...

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:47.960
Help...

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:35.840
If I kill you,

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.120
will...

00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:39.159
will Yunyun come back to me?

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.799
