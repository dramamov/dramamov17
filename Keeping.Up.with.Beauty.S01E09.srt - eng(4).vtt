00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:24.959
Are you alright?

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:25.879
Did you get hurt?

00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:26.439
I'm fine.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.200
Find your phone
and call the police first.

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:30.319
Didn't expect you to know
how to fight like that.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.840
I had no idea.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.840
There are still many things
you don't know.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.359
Thank you.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.840
From now on,

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.400
I'll try to know you better.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.519
No battery.

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:56.799
Mine's dead too.

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:01.560
We probably can't make it
to the board meeting.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.719
Let's head out first.

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.000
Maybe we can still make it.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.319
Watch out!

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.280
Go to hell!

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.919
Gu Chenyu!

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.400
Gu Chenyu!

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.560
Hang in there.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.560
We'll get out first.

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:24.680
What time is it now?

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:26.759
Why isn't Gu Chenyu here yet?

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.879
How dare he be late
on such an important day.

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:32.479
Unbelievable.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.520
Does he already think
he'll be the new head of the Gu family?

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:40.919
Uncle.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.560
No need to rush.

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:43.840
Let's wait a bit longer.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.639
No need.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.439
Let's begin.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.199
The old madam woke up last night.

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.639
After the doctor's diagnosis,

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.039
her brain suffered irreversible damage.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.439
She's showing signs of dementia

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:58.719
and she'll need long-term care
in hospital.

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:02.599
The Gu family needs a new head.

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.919
The head of the Gu family
isn't only the family leader,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.879
but also the president of Gu Group.

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:11.080
It should be decided
by shareholding ratio.

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:16.439
The old madam once signed a document.

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:19.120
If one day she met with an accident

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.319
and could no longer serve
as the family head,

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:28.520
then her 32 percent share in Gu Group

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.199
would be divided in two,

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.439
half to her grandson Gu Yansheng

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.159
and half to Gu Chenyu.

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.159
Including this portion,

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:37.719
Gu Chenyu

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:41.639
would hold 35 percent of Gu Group,

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.199
making him the largest shareholder.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.639
Gu Yansheng

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.159
would hold 26 percent,

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.840
becoming the second largest shareholder.

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.879
Therefore,

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:52.599
Gu Chenyu

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.319
shall be the next...

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.879
Wait a moment.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.039
So,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.240
the one holding the most shares now

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.400
will become

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.159
the next head of the Gu family?

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.639
According to tradition, yes.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.280
After my husband passed away,

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.959
I held 10 percent of the group's shares.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.000
Now I

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:22.040
voluntarily transfer these shares

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:25.240
(Gu Group Share Transfer Agreement)
to my son, Gu Yansheng.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.959
Yansheng now holds
over 36 percent of the company,

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.120
becoming the largest shareholder.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.800
Gu Yansheng

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:36.680
is more qualified
than Gu Chenyu to be the family head.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.800
Such an important matter,

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.240
since Gu Chenyu isn't here,

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.920
why don't we postpone it?

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.480
No need.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.399
Everyone's time is precious.

00:04:57.399 --> 00:04:58.759
It's not easy to call a meeting.

00:04:58.959 --> 00:05:00.680
We can't just delay it.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.639
Gu Chenyu isn't family head yet,

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.519
but he already ignores us.

00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:05.519
Once he's in power,

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:06.839
he'll be even more arrogant.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.000
We better just choose Yansheng.

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:10.000
Agreed.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.000
Then...

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:19.399
Thank you for your support, elders.

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:21.120
Let's proceed with the vote.

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:23.680
Shareholders in favour of Gu Yansheng

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.000
becoming the new head of the Gu family,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.790
please raise your hand.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.000
Mr. Gu.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.839
You're awake.

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:21.720
Give me your hand.

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:36.680
Pulse is normal.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.519
No major harm.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.959
Luckily this time
the internal organs weren't pierced,

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:41.759
but you lost too much blood.

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:43.560
Your vital energy is severely depleted
and need to rest.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.879
However,

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.199
why is your heart racing so fast?

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:54.800
The blanket's too warm.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.319
Shen,

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:02.600
at the board meeting,

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.839
has Gu Yansheng
already become family head?

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:07.399
Except for Third Uncle
and the two uncles,

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.639
everyone else voted in favour.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.759
He bought off so many people,

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:13.519
seems premeditated.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.439
My stepmother,

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:19.319
for the sake of her own son,

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.319
really went to great lengths.

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:23.720
It's a pity those bandits got away.

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:25.759
Now there's no evidence to prove

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.480
these matters are connected
to Bai Lanxing and Gu Yansheng.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.600
Shen,

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.959
thank you for today.

00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:36.360
If you hadn't arrived in time,

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.480
things would have been dire.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:38.680
It wasn't me.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.439
Yunyun.

00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:48.920
Flowers suit the beauty.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.439
Thank you.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.480
Thank...

00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:53.360
Thank you.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.480
Stabbed and still so spirited.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.439
Mr. Gu really is tough.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.319
Thank you.

00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:01.680
I need to rest.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.759
See the guests out.

00:08:09.079 --> 00:08:10.160
You treat

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.279
your lifesaver like this?

00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:16.120
He… He saved me?

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.199
Gu Chenyu, hold on.

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:28.370
I'll take you to hospital right away.

00:08:32.759 --> 00:08:33.639
Anyone here?

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.480
Is anyone here?

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:44.320
Yunyun.

00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:50.919
Come.

00:08:55.919 --> 00:08:57.720
Luckily Yunyun
shared her location with me.

00:08:58.559 --> 00:09:00.320
I saw her position
moving into a remote area.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.240
I guessed she was in trouble.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.000
Actually, it was quite dangerous.

00:09:05.759 --> 00:09:07.320
Thanks for helping out.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.159
No need to mention it.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.039
As long as it's to see you,

00:09:10.039 --> 00:09:11.440
I'd go through fire and water.

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:13.720
Thirsty.

00:09:14.039 --> 00:09:15.080
Gu Chenyu,

00:09:15.799 --> 00:09:17.000
you should thank him too.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.120
He saved your life.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:23.720
Thank you.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.559
You're welcome.

00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:26.240
I was looking for Yunyun.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.240
You just happened to be along the way.

00:09:28.559 --> 00:09:29.480
Don't be too moved.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.159
We're family after all.

00:09:32.759 --> 00:09:34.639
Helping her is helping me.

00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:40.240
Then I won't disturb Mr. Gu's rest.

00:09:41.879 --> 00:09:43.039
After all that trouble,

00:09:43.039 --> 00:09:43.960
you look worn out.

00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:46.039
You should take care
of yourself as you age.

00:09:46.039 --> 00:09:46.759
Otherwise,

00:09:46.759 --> 00:09:47.519
you'll age faster.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.320
I'll walk you out.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:52.960
Alright.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.000
Otherwise, you'll age faster.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.440
Do I...

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.320
Do I look worn out?
