=Episode 17=

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.359
What?

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.920
They got divorced?

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.679
Yeah.

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:03.679
I saw them sign the divorce papers
with my own eyes.

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:06.280
Yunyun moved out this morning.

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:09.280
Yansheng, where are you going?

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.439
Didn't the doctor say you
could only be discharged tomorrow?

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:19.799
Fu Yunyun.

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:22.400
What I promised you,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.480
I've finally done.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.020
(Command)

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.359
Yunyun.

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:35.599
No...

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:37.159
General.

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.040
Congratulations.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.239
What's wrong?

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.959
It's strange.

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:50.359
I'm about to return
to a thousand years ago,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.560
but why does my heart hurt so much?

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.840
As if I've been struck by an arrow.

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:06.159
It's alright.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.640
You still have me.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.240
No matter how many years we cross,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.439
whether you're Nangong Yu or Fu Yunyun,

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:14.240
I'll always stay by your side.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.560
Across a thousand years?

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.840
Nangong Yu?

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:33.240
Muyan.

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:34.680
Why don't you go back first?

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.840
I want to be alone for a bit.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.080
Alright.

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:10.680
Yunyun.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.639
Why are you here?

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:19.000
Yunyun.

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:23.400
I already know.

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:27.560
You had your reasons
for marrying my brother back then.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.000
Now that you're divorced,

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.759
and you've taken Jiangxing back,

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.479
nothing stands in our way anymore.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.360
Why don't we start over?

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.240
Gu Yansheng,

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.919
the past is already behind us.

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:46.080
There shouldn't be
any more stories between us.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.680
Do you really

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.879
not have even a little

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:54.680
feeling left for me?

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.479
None.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.919
Here.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.439
Look what I've brought you.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.280
What's this?

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.480
You don't recognise it?

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.959
Let me touch it.

00:04:25.959 --> 00:04:26.959
Maybe I'll remember.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.319
Who are you really?

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.920
Yunyun could never
forget forget-me-nots.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.360
They were her favourite flowers!

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.319
You're not Fu Yunyun.

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:37.560
Then where's my Yunyun?

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:52.560
I'm a soul from a thousand years ago.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.839
Because of an ancestral General's Command,

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.360
I answered Fu Yunyun's call
before her death

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:59.720
and came here to fulfill her final wish.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.560
Who are you trying to fool?

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.639
What do you mean "before her death"?

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.720
What final wish?

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:09.319
Yunyun must still be inside this body.

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:11.319
As long as this body lives,

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:12.360
she won't die.

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:15.160
See?

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.560
Her hands are still warm.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.360
Warm!

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.360
Her hands are still warm!

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.920
Yunyun isn't dead.

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:25.120
She's not dead!

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.720
The night Old Madam Gu

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.519
was poisoned,

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.800
Fu Yunyun was falsely accused
of being the one behind it all.

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:50.720
She slit her wrists in her room.

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:52.879
After her death,

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:55.319
I was summoned into her body.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.439
Do you still remember that night?

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.319
The night I knocked you out.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.240
That was the first time I met you.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.040
Didn't you think I was strange?

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:12.399
My brother's room was right next door.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.240
Do you want me to call him out for you?

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.000
The one I'm marrying
is the head of the Gu family.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.160
You're not worthy.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.519
Did you really fall in love
with my brother?

00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:21.199
Impossible.

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:22.560
You could never love him!

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.040
Lies.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.639
What wrist-slitting suicide?

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:35.959
What summoning?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.120
A thousand years ago?

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.000
Nangong Yu?

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.959
Lies.

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:42.399
You're lying about everything.

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:43.600
All lies.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.519
Impossible.

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:46.079
Impossible.

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:47.639
Impossible!

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:49.639
All liars!

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:32.639
What flower is this?

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.399
Forget-me-not.

00:07:42.439 --> 00:07:44.959
Yansheng, study hard.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.800
I'll wait for you to come back.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.399
When I come back,

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:52.920
I'll tell everyone about us.

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:55.000
We'll never be apart again.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.519
Okay.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.240
Two years will pass quickly.

00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:00.399
You must wait for me.

00:08:49.039 --> 00:08:50.360
Why are you drinking alone?

00:08:54.759 --> 00:08:57.039
None of your business.

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.320
You're an adult.

00:09:00.679 --> 00:09:02.039
Still acting like a child.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:36.150
Are you alright, Chenyu?

00:10:36.879 --> 00:10:37.840
Do you want some water?

00:10:38.399 --> 00:10:39.200
I'm fine.

00:10:39.919 --> 00:10:41.399
I just drank too much last night.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.639
You and Yansheng
really scared me yesterday.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.759
All my life,

00:10:45.759 --> 00:10:47.600
I've never seen you two drink that much.

00:10:47.919 --> 00:10:49.399
And together, no less.

00:10:49.919 --> 00:10:52.360
Looks like
you talked quite a bit last night.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.200
What's wrong?

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:58.840
Nothing.

00:11:02.799 --> 00:11:03.120
Chenyu.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:03.840
We're here.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.240
What's wrong with your eyes?

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.240
My vision's a little blurry.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.120
The doctor told me

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.720
I'm going to lose my sight soon.
