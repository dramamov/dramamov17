(Feng Zuoren, Xue Guardian Commander)

00:02:38.312 --> 00:02:42.920
(Emperor Jia,
Emperor of the Hua Dynasty)

00:02:51.482 --> 00:02:53.962
The Xue Guardians
have eliminated the traitors.

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:59.003
Commander Feng Zuoren, heed the command.

00:03:04.723 --> 00:03:05.603
I command you

00:03:05.603 --> 00:03:08.123
to marry into
the Xue family of Lord Dingyuan.

00:03:09.003 --> 00:03:11.003
Jia Xun is definitely hiding there.

00:03:11.283 --> 00:03:13.962
You must find him before others do

00:03:15.242 --> 00:03:16.682
and bring me his head.

00:03:19.003 --> 00:03:20.482
I will locate the remnants

00:03:20.843 --> 00:03:22.123
and eradicate them

00:03:22.362 --> 00:03:23.522
to protect our nation.

00:03:31.802 --> 00:03:32.403
Get up.

00:03:35.443 --> 00:03:36.522
It's a crucial matter.

00:03:37.123 --> 00:03:38.123
Do not

00:03:38.642 --> 00:03:39.883
be exposed.

00:03:42.482 --> 00:03:43.043
Understood.

00:03:45.522 --> 00:03:47.403
(His Majesty has been in poor health.)

00:03:47.603 --> 00:03:48.843
(The prince is still young.)

00:03:49.003 --> 00:03:50.202
(The nation)

00:03:50.323 --> 00:03:51.962
(hangs in precarious balance.)

00:03:52.123 --> 00:03:53.082
(Years ago,)

00:03:53.242 --> 00:03:56.163
(His Majesty's brother Jia Xun
was the Crown Prince.)

00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:57.682
(Exiled among commoners,)

00:03:58.242 --> 00:04:00.642
(he has turned twenty this year.)

00:04:01.082 --> 00:04:02.362
(We implore Your Majesty)

00:04:02.563 --> 00:04:05.242
(to reclaim Jia Xun
and restore his royal status)

00:04:05.403 --> 00:04:07.362
(to stabilize the court.)

00:04:15.082 --> 00:04:16.136
(Xue's Textile)
A new textile shop

00:04:16.136 --> 00:04:17.576
opened on Xue Street?

00:04:22.043 --> 00:04:23.442
What a pretty lady.

00:04:25.643 --> 00:04:27.442
Don't tell me she's the shopkeeper.

00:04:32.283 --> 00:04:33.283
Are you the shopkeeper?

00:04:38.802 --> 00:04:40.322
Where can I get this fabric?

00:04:44.424 --> 00:04:46.763
It looks amazing.

00:04:48.682 --> 00:04:49.922
We have new stock.

00:04:50.043 --> 00:04:51.083
Come see inside.

00:04:52.043 --> 00:04:52.922
Alright.

00:04:53.682 --> 00:04:54.603
Alright.

00:04:57.963 --> 00:04:58.843
Zhang Er'gou.

00:05:00.002 --> 00:05:01.763
Get your filthy hands off her.

(Xue Hexu, Second Son of the Xue Family)

00:05:09.362 --> 00:05:10.203
Xue Hexu.

00:05:10.882 --> 00:05:11.682
You again?

00:05:12.802 --> 00:05:14.083
What an epic entrance.

00:05:14.603 --> 00:05:15.362
Collect your rent

00:05:15.442 --> 00:05:16.963
and stay out of this.

00:05:17.242 --> 00:05:18.242
You punk.

00:05:18.403 --> 00:05:20.002
Don't you know who runs this place?

00:05:20.882 --> 00:05:22.043
Harassing the shopkeeper

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:23.922
means opposing the Xue family.

00:05:24.083 --> 00:05:24.922
Don't forget

00:05:25.083 --> 00:05:27.482
that your mother
rents our butcher stall.

00:05:28.122 --> 00:05:30.283
That's your family's only livelihood.

00:05:32.643 --> 00:05:33.403
Now get lost.

00:05:51.283 --> 00:05:52.843
Thank you for helping, young master.

00:05:53.723 --> 00:05:54.362
No problem.

00:05:54.802 --> 00:05:57.802
Since you rent from us for business,

00:05:57.864 --> 00:05:58.632
it's our duty

00:05:59.163 --> 00:06:00.283
to protect you.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.562
Here's six months' rent.

00:06:10.643 --> 00:06:12.763
So prompt with the rent payments.

00:06:20.523 --> 00:06:22.482
But with such sparse business,

00:06:23.362 --> 00:06:25.882
where does the money come from?

00:06:26.403 --> 00:06:27.963
It's even newly minted.

00:06:30.408 --> 00:06:33.002
If I hadn't intervened,

00:06:33.544 --> 00:06:34.482
Zhang Er'gou

00:06:34.882 --> 00:06:36.682
would've died by now, right?

00:06:53.322 --> 00:06:54.203
Does anyone want

00:06:54.442 --> 00:06:55.242
a rent reduction?

00:06:57.163 --> 00:06:57.882
Mr. Xue.

00:06:58.442 --> 00:06:59.322
You mean it?

00:06:59.976 --> 00:07:01.882
My family and I always keep our word.

00:07:02.882 --> 00:07:05.403
But there's no free lunch from you.

00:07:05.643 --> 00:07:07.242
What do you want in exchange?

00:07:07.802 --> 00:07:08.882
We know your methods

00:07:08.882 --> 00:07:10.203
all too well.

00:07:10.203 --> 00:07:10.922
Nonsense.

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:13.603
This lady is trying

00:07:13.802 --> 00:07:14.922
to make a living alone.

00:07:15.682 --> 00:07:17.963
A nearby neighbor
is better than a distant family.

00:07:18.203 --> 00:07:18.802
You will

00:07:18.856 --> 00:07:20.963
keep her protected.

00:07:21.384 --> 00:07:22.442
Keep watch on her shop

00:07:22.562 --> 00:07:24.603
for any suspicious activity.

00:07:24.682 --> 00:07:25.643
Keep me updated.

00:07:25.963 --> 00:07:27.122
Useful leads get you

00:07:27.283 --> 00:07:28.362
10% off on the rent

00:07:28.562 --> 00:07:30.002
starting next month.

00:07:30.922 --> 00:07:31.562
Alright.

00:07:31.562 --> 00:07:32.322
I guarantee

00:07:32.322 --> 00:07:33.802
not even a fly will get through.

00:07:36.283 --> 00:07:36.843
Madam.

00:07:41.403 --> 00:07:42.043
You'd better

00:07:42.362 --> 00:07:44.002
not cause trouble on our turf.

00:07:44.603 --> 00:07:45.922
If you're looking for trouble,

00:07:46.523 --> 00:07:47.482
pack up and leave.

00:07:49.802 --> 00:07:51.163
(Once I marry into your family,)

00:07:52.242 --> 00:07:53.523
(the first person I kill)

00:07:54.088 --> 00:07:54.922
(will be you.)

00:07:55.362 --> 00:07:56.043
Mr. Xue.

00:07:56.362 --> 00:07:57.362
Something happened.

00:07:59.944 --> 00:08:02.760
(Xue Mansion)

00:08:04.648 --> 00:08:09.352
(Xue Fugui, Lord Dingyuan)

00:08:14.083 --> 00:08:15.643
His Majesty assigned you a bride?

00:08:16.603 --> 00:08:18.163
His Majesty fell for the rumors

00:08:19.002 --> 00:08:20.442
and believes that

00:08:20.562 --> 00:08:23.163
we're hiding
the former Crown Prince Jia Xun.

00:08:23.882 --> 00:08:26.643
He assigned me a new wife to investigate

00:08:26.802 --> 00:08:28.002
and spy on us.

00:08:28.882 --> 00:08:31.002
The former Crown Prince
disappeared years ago.

00:08:31.482 --> 00:08:32.602
Why bring it up now?

00:08:33.403 --> 00:08:36.003
His Majesty is gravely ill.

00:08:36.842 --> 00:08:39.403
His only son is too young
to inherit the throne.

00:08:40.168 --> 00:08:43.082
He must be recalling
his own usurpation of power

00:08:44.483 --> 00:08:47.883
and fearing that Jia Xun
might return to claim the throne.

00:08:49.123 --> 00:08:50.043
Such battles

00:08:50.842 --> 00:08:52.163
always bring bloodshed.

00:08:53.123 --> 00:08:55.962
Those in power
never consider the people's welfare.

00:08:56.523 --> 00:08:58.283
With His Majesty's paranoia,

00:08:59.336 --> 00:09:02.082
he'd rather slaughter innocents
than take risks.

00:09:03.016 --> 00:09:06.363
Our family
stands on the brink of disaster.

00:09:08.523 --> 00:09:10.962
Don't tell your grandmother yet.

00:09:12.523 --> 00:09:15.883
If that new bride
makes any suspicious move...

00:09:16.043 --> 00:09:16.744
I'll kill her.

00:09:19.163 --> 00:09:19.643
Father,

00:09:20.202 --> 00:09:22.483
I won't let anyone harm the Xue family.

00:09:23.283 --> 00:09:26.363
You're ruthless toward outsiders.

00:09:29.442 --> 00:09:30.523
Perhaps

00:09:31.163 --> 00:09:33.363
it's good for you.

00:09:36.968 --> 00:09:40.200
(Grand Tutor's Mansion)

00:09:43.283 --> 00:09:44.802
This is madness.

00:09:45.363 --> 00:09:47.442
They brought up the former Crown Prince

00:09:47.842 --> 00:09:50.123
(Grand Tutor Zhou, Top Grand Tutor)
to force His Majesty's

00:09:50.722 --> 00:09:52.403
abdication in his sickbed.

00:09:53.082 --> 00:09:54.202
Let's kill them

00:09:55.003 --> 00:09:56.403
as a warning to others.

00:09:59.602 --> 00:10:01.722
Someone might have beaten you to it.

00:10:02.163 --> 00:10:04.243
Chief Gu Qianfu of Jing'an Bureau.

00:10:04.842 --> 00:10:06.523
Go to Lord Dingyuan's mansion.

00:10:06.962 --> 00:10:08.488
Find the former Crown Prince.

00:10:09.082 --> 00:10:10.003
And execute him

00:10:10.883 --> 00:10:12.163
as a warning to others.

00:10:12.483 --> 00:10:13.883
Wait. Don't kill him.

00:10:14.202 --> 00:10:15.562
Bring him to me alive.

00:10:16.123 --> 00:10:17.442
I will bring him to you.

00:10:18.082 --> 00:10:19.403
You shall execute him

00:10:19.912 --> 00:10:21.483
as a warning to others.

00:10:23.912 --> 00:10:24.842
That's right.

00:10:25.922 --> 00:10:27.883
Nowadays, His Majesty depends heavily

00:10:28.363 --> 00:10:29.562
on the Xue Guardians

00:10:30.003 --> 00:10:31.816
and forgets the Jing'an Bureau.

00:10:32.243 --> 00:10:33.802
We must not lose to them.

00:10:34.722 --> 00:10:35.403
Gu Qianfu.

00:10:36.082 --> 00:10:38.043
As the backbone of the Jing'an Bureau,

00:10:38.523 --> 00:10:40.363
you must outperform the Xue Guardians.

00:10:40.962 --> 00:10:42.243
I'll kill them.

00:10:42.504 --> 00:10:43.602
Get to work.

00:10:54.216 --> 00:10:56.602
(His Majesty's schemes run deep.)

00:10:57.322 --> 00:10:58.243
(You think)

00:10:58.243 --> 00:11:00.842
(this can secure the throne
for your young son?)

00:11:01.562 --> 00:11:04.043
(Once I identify
the real former Crown Prince,)

00:11:04.202 --> 00:11:05.123
(this empire)

00:11:05.322 --> 00:11:06.682
(will be mine.)

00:11:07.272 --> 00:11:10.152
(Xue Mansion)

00:11:10.152 --> 00:11:13.000
(Xue Street)

00:11:27.283 --> 00:11:29.802
His Majesty
sends a new bride to our family.

00:11:30.243 --> 00:11:31.682
(Liu Jiaoqian, Xue Dongfang's wife)
What should

00:11:32.123 --> 00:11:33.896
Dongyang and I do if she bears children?

00:11:34.082 --> 00:11:37.163
Besides, I heard
Ms. Wang is a military hero

00:11:37.523 --> 00:11:38.283
who just returned

00:11:38.802 --> 00:11:39.643
from the border.

00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:41.123
Don't worry.

00:11:41.483 --> 00:11:42.082
This wedding

00:11:42.403 --> 00:11:43.082
may help Father

00:11:43.202 --> 00:11:44.643
recover from illness.

00:12:26.883 --> 00:12:27.922
Don't lift the veil yet.

00:12:28.043 --> 00:12:29.283
The wedding isn't completed.

00:12:29.842 --> 00:12:30.363
It's fine.

00:12:30.883 --> 00:12:32.883
I care little for such formalities.

00:12:34.363 --> 00:12:34.922
Mr. Xue.

00:12:35.363 --> 00:12:36.562
The textile shop is closed.

00:12:36.562 --> 00:12:37.363
The shopkeeper

00:12:37.363 --> 00:12:38.763
said she's getting married.

00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:39.523
I know.

00:12:39.802 --> 00:12:40.922
She's right here.

00:12:43.883 --> 00:12:44.802
So, you are Ms. Wang.

00:12:47.883 --> 00:12:48.682
You're acquainted?

00:12:49.123 --> 00:12:50.483
My father gave me a textile shop

00:12:50.643 --> 00:12:52.082
to experience commoners' lives.

00:12:52.602 --> 00:12:53.802
But I'm bad at this.

00:12:54.442 --> 00:12:55.763
Please don't laugh at me.

00:12:56.483 --> 00:12:58.123
From now on, we'll be family.

00:12:58.483 --> 00:13:00.883
I could use your guidance
on many things, Mr. Xue.

00:13:02.003 --> 00:13:03.403
He shouldn't be guiding you.

00:13:03.602 --> 00:13:05.082
You'll be our stepmother.

00:13:05.523 --> 00:13:06.922
It's you who should guide us.

00:13:07.176 --> 00:13:07.922
Hexu, greet our

00:13:08.123 --> 00:13:08.842
stepmother.

00:13:09.202 --> 00:13:10.363
Bad news.

00:13:10.883 --> 00:13:12.003
Something went wrong.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:19.588
(Xue Dongyang,
First Son of the Xue Family)

00:13:19.802 --> 00:13:20.363
Hurry.

00:13:20.483 --> 00:13:21.483
Our lord is dying.

00:13:22.442 --> 00:13:22.883
Father.

00:13:24.562 --> 00:13:25.562
Father, are you okay?

00:13:28.072 --> 00:13:28.682
Father.

00:13:30.243 --> 00:13:32.322
(Who wanted to kill Lord Dingyuan?)

00:13:33.562 --> 00:13:34.523
(Who did it?)

00:13:41.483 --> 00:13:42.682
Father. Father.

00:13:42.682 --> 00:13:43.802
What happened?

00:13:44.243 --> 00:13:45.283
We just got married.

00:13:45.562 --> 00:13:47.202
How am I supposed to live

00:13:48.643 --> 00:13:50.483
if anything happens to my lord?

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.883
Dongyang, don't be scared.

00:13:56.003 --> 00:13:57.043
Have some candy.

00:14:01.442 --> 00:14:02.082
Tell me.

00:14:02.322 --> 00:14:03.082
What did you see?

00:14:05.082 --> 00:14:06.922
Jiaoqian wouldn't let me have candies.

00:14:07.363 --> 00:14:09.523
So I came looking for candies.

00:14:10.322 --> 00:14:12.802
I saw Father wrestling someone for fun.

00:14:13.643 --> 00:14:14.722
I wanted to play, too.

00:14:15.363 --> 00:14:16.202
Wrestling?

00:14:16.922 --> 00:14:17.802
Father is ill.

00:14:17.802 --> 00:14:18.722
How can he wrestle?

00:14:22.643 --> 00:14:23.722
(Someone else was here?)

00:14:24.243 --> 00:14:25.523
(How reckless.)

00:14:25.763 --> 00:14:26.922
(The target is alerted.)

00:14:27.483 --> 00:14:28.842
Dongyang didn't know Father

00:14:29.243 --> 00:14:30.123
was under attack,

00:14:31.003 --> 00:14:32.483
and he made a commotion.

00:14:33.483 --> 00:14:35.043
The assassin got scared and escaped.

00:14:37.562 --> 00:14:38.483
You saved Father.

00:14:38.922 --> 00:14:39.722
You're so brave.

00:14:44.483 --> 00:14:45.160
Let's report it.

00:14:49.768 --> 00:14:50.403
Ms. Wang.

00:14:51.602 --> 00:14:52.722
I'm afraid you won't

00:14:53.442 --> 00:14:54.562
be able to marry my father.

00:14:59.043 --> 00:14:59.883
This is unfortunate.

00:15:00.243 --> 00:15:00.922
We're in trouble

00:15:01.243 --> 00:15:02.523
right on the day you came.

00:15:03.243 --> 00:15:04.003
Why don't you stay

00:15:04.442 --> 00:15:04.883
at home

00:15:05.243 --> 00:15:06.442
in case you get implicated?

00:15:08.403 --> 00:15:09.243
(Xue Hexu.)

00:15:09.442 --> 00:15:10.483
(Second son of Xue Fugui.)

00:15:10.602 --> 00:15:11.442
(Household manager.)

00:15:11.842 --> 00:15:12.363
(Age 20.)

00:15:12.483 --> 00:15:13.363
(Target No.1.)

00:15:14.682 --> 00:15:15.483
(Xue Dongyang.)

00:15:15.802 --> 00:15:16.842
(First son of Xue Fugui.)

00:15:17.003 --> 00:15:18.043
(Husband of Liu Jiaoqian.)

00:15:18.163 --> 00:15:18.922
(Age 23.)

00:15:19.082 --> 00:15:19.842
(Target No.2.)

00:15:20.123 --> 00:15:21.082
(Could be playing dumb.)

00:15:21.202 --> 00:15:22.043
Pretty lady.

00:15:23.403 --> 00:15:24.962
Dongyang, watch it.

00:15:25.442 --> 00:15:26.123
(Xue Nuannuan.)

00:15:26.643 --> 00:15:27.784
(Daughter of Xue Fugui.)

00:15:27.883 --> 00:15:29.322
(Xue Nuannuan of Xue Family)
(Twin sister of Xue Hexu.)

00:15:29.562 --> 00:15:30.202
(Age 20.)

00:15:30.403 --> 00:15:31.602
(Could be under disguise.)

00:15:31.842 --> 00:15:32.643
(Target No.3.)

00:15:33.483 --> 00:15:34.962
(The former Crown Prince)

00:15:35.123 --> 00:15:36.082
(could be anyone.)

00:15:36.483 --> 00:15:38.322
(Kill them all
so that he can't get away.)

00:15:39.082 --> 00:15:39.883
(Everyone is here.)

00:15:40.043 --> 00:15:41.163
(No outsiders.)

00:15:41.962 --> 00:15:43.442
(It's time for them to perish.)

00:15:45.082 --> 00:15:45.842
(You can't wait)

00:15:46.283 --> 00:15:47.722
(to make a move.)

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:51.272
(Grandma, Xue Mansion)

00:15:52.243 --> 00:15:53.403
(She's in charge.)

00:15:57.802 --> 00:15:58.562
Madam.

00:15:59.363 --> 00:16:00.922
I am Lord Dingyuan's wife-to-be.

00:16:01.442 --> 00:16:02.602
I consider myself his wife,

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:05.283
although we haven't held the wedding.

00:16:06.043 --> 00:16:07.202
How can I walk away

00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:09.202
when the lord is ill?

00:16:14.202 --> 00:16:15.403
Good girl.

00:16:16.488 --> 00:16:19.442
You're so devoted to my son.

00:16:20.243 --> 00:16:20.682
Fine.

00:16:21.523 --> 00:16:22.682
You sound devoted.

00:16:23.003 --> 00:16:25.602
I heard that the Yuechuan River
is blessed by the river god.

00:16:26.043 --> 00:16:27.763
We can offer you to the river god

00:16:28.643 --> 00:16:30.403
to restore health to my father.

00:16:30.643 --> 00:16:32.763
That's the least
you could do for my father.

00:16:33.442 --> 00:16:34.408
Be sacrificed or leave.

00:16:34.643 --> 00:16:35.163
Ms. Wang.

00:16:35.602 --> 00:16:36.202
Your choice.

00:16:37.363 --> 00:16:39.283
We are a family of military people.

00:16:39.962 --> 00:16:41.123
How can we send her to die?

00:16:41.283 --> 00:16:41.922
Hexu.

00:16:42.043 --> 00:16:43.442
We can't break the law.

00:16:44.584 --> 00:16:45.483
Mr. Xue.

00:16:46.322 --> 00:16:47.442
Since I'm married

00:16:47.962 --> 00:16:49.123
to your father,

00:16:49.992 --> 00:16:52.123
I can't leave when my husband

00:16:52.523 --> 00:16:53.483
is in trouble.

00:16:55.243 --> 00:16:56.483
Good girl.

00:16:57.123 --> 00:16:58.202
Greet your stepmother.

00:16:59.043 --> 00:17:00.123
I suggested that

00:17:00.123 --> 00:17:02.283
because Ms. Wang is devoted to Father.

00:17:02.802 --> 00:17:03.523
Besides,

00:17:03.922 --> 00:17:04.802
Father is badly ill,

00:17:04.842 --> 00:17:05.642
and she is loyal.

00:17:05.802 --> 00:17:06.963
My suggestion makes sense.

00:17:07.523 --> 00:17:08.322
Hexu.

00:17:08.683 --> 00:17:10.362
Why don't you sacrifice yourself?

00:17:10.683 --> 00:17:12.243
She's married to your father.

00:17:12.642 --> 00:17:14.043
That makes her our family.

00:17:14.882 --> 00:17:18.162
We should look after each other.
That's what matters.

00:17:19.283 --> 00:17:20.602
You're so against her.

00:17:21.122 --> 00:17:22.243
Could it be...

00:17:31.122 --> 00:17:33.683
You don't want her
to bear children and replace you

00:17:33.842 --> 00:17:34.963
as the heir?

00:17:37.683 --> 00:17:40.082
Don't be so petty.

00:17:42.443 --> 00:17:44.322
(They look quite innocent.)

00:17:45.322 --> 00:17:47.082
(But for His Majesty's reign,)

00:17:47.683 --> 00:17:49.203
(they must all die.)

00:17:50.963 --> 00:17:52.483
You treat me so kindly.

00:17:53.043 --> 00:17:55.523
I don't know how to repay you.

00:17:58.642 --> 00:18:00.122
Let me offer you tea

00:18:00.362 --> 00:18:01.443
to express my gratitude.

00:18:21.963 --> 00:18:22.642
Madam.

00:18:25.122 --> 00:18:26.642
I'm thirsty. I'll drink first.

00:18:26.763 --> 00:18:27.322
Thanks.

00:18:27.842 --> 00:18:28.923
Ungrateful brat.

00:18:29.322 --> 00:18:31.003
You shouldn't drink the tea

00:18:31.203 --> 00:18:32.523
your stepmother offers to me.

00:18:33.362 --> 00:18:34.043
Alright.

00:18:34.283 --> 00:18:35.082
You're right.

00:18:35.243 --> 00:18:36.162
I was wrong.

00:18:36.723 --> 00:18:38.402
This tea serves as my apology.

00:18:38.562 --> 00:18:39.963
I offer this to you.

00:18:40.082 --> 00:18:40.602
Stepmother.

00:18:41.003 --> 00:18:41.763
Please drink.

00:18:42.723 --> 00:18:44.923
Thank you for marrying my father.

00:18:46.122 --> 00:18:48.162
(This person is truly obstructive.)

00:18:50.602 --> 00:18:51.602
You won't accept the tea.

00:18:51.963 --> 00:18:52.923
Are you blaming me

00:18:53.043 --> 00:18:54.162
for offending you?

00:18:57.443 --> 00:18:58.402
Or perhaps,

00:18:58.642 --> 00:19:00.723
you're behind what happened today?

00:19:15.122 --> 00:19:15.882
Assassins!

00:19:16.683 --> 00:19:17.802
(Jing'an Bureau's daggers.)

00:19:18.562 --> 00:19:19.432
(Grand Tutor Zhou.)

00:19:19.963 --> 00:19:21.243
(Why did he attack us?)

00:19:21.963 --> 00:19:23.483
(How dare you betray His Majesty?)

00:19:23.602 --> 00:19:24.203
Stay calm.

00:19:24.322 --> 00:19:25.082
Follow our drills.

00:19:25.243 --> 00:19:25.963
Hide first.

00:19:26.082 --> 00:19:27.043
I'll secure the hall.

00:19:30.923 --> 00:19:31.723
(They're so fast!)

00:19:59.944 --> 00:20:03.240
(Gu Qianfu, Chief of Jing'an Bureau)

00:20:03.523 --> 00:20:04.523
Gu Qianfu.

00:20:05.322 --> 00:20:06.312
Feng Zuoren.

00:20:07.122 --> 00:20:08.402
Long time no see.

00:20:08.963 --> 00:20:10.963
You fools are courting death,

00:20:11.443 --> 00:20:12.362
coming to my turf.

00:20:12.802 --> 00:20:14.203
I've always thought

00:20:14.523 --> 00:20:16.243
that you're a man.

00:20:16.963 --> 00:20:17.443
Right.

00:20:18.162 --> 00:20:20.243
Are you a guy or a girl?

00:20:20.602 --> 00:20:21.602
How dare you!

00:20:22.842 --> 00:20:23.963
Trying to kill me again?

00:20:24.923 --> 00:20:26.203
I know what you did.

00:20:26.443 --> 00:20:27.963
You were about to exterminate

00:20:28.683 --> 00:20:30.443
the entire Xue family.

00:20:37.602 --> 00:20:38.443
Bone-Eroding Powder.

00:20:38.882 --> 00:20:40.243
It erodes the bone marrow.

00:20:40.802 --> 00:20:41.683
You're doomed.

00:20:43.443 --> 00:20:45.443
Thank goodness you're safe, Stepmother.

00:20:46.243 --> 00:20:47.162
I was so worried.

00:20:47.523 --> 00:20:48.483
You again?

00:20:48.723 --> 00:20:49.802
I was worried about you.

00:20:51.362 --> 00:20:51.923
What's that?

00:21:02.763 --> 00:21:03.763
Petty trick.

00:21:04.082 --> 00:21:05.523
I can kill your whole family.

00:21:06.122 --> 00:21:06.683
Madam.

00:21:07.322 --> 00:21:08.562
Why would a master like you

00:21:09.162 --> 00:21:11.443
try to exterminate my entire family?

00:21:12.362 --> 00:21:13.003
Name your price.

00:21:13.443 --> 00:21:14.322
I can pay you.

00:21:14.683 --> 00:21:16.203
Why do I want to kill you?

00:21:16.683 --> 00:21:17.842
Are you really clueless?

00:21:19.322 --> 00:21:19.802
I...

00:21:20.362 --> 00:21:21.322
I'm totally clueless.

00:21:22.882 --> 00:21:24.243
You came in broad daylight.

00:21:24.683 --> 00:21:26.162
Everybody has seen your face.

00:21:26.882 --> 00:21:29.003
If my family dies on the same day,

00:21:29.723 --> 00:21:30.562
where can you

00:21:30.683 --> 00:21:31.523
possibly hide?

00:21:32.162 --> 00:21:33.243
The authorities will

00:21:33.683 --> 00:21:34.283
arrest you.

00:21:34.882 --> 00:21:35.763
Are you suicidal?

00:21:37.283 --> 00:21:38.243
My single life

00:21:38.402 --> 00:21:39.723
for your entire clan's lives.

00:21:40.043 --> 00:21:40.562
Fair trade.

00:21:42.602 --> 00:21:44.763
Is there no one

00:21:45.082 --> 00:21:46.683
you care about in this world?

00:21:55.322 --> 00:21:56.122
Those I cared about

00:21:57.602 --> 00:21:58.602
all perished long ago.

00:22:04.362 --> 00:22:05.923
Bone-Eroding Powder, huh?

00:22:06.642 --> 00:22:07.642
Feng Zuoren.

00:22:22.003 --> 00:22:22.562
Gu Qianfu.

00:22:23.048 --> 00:22:23.802
Got a death wish?

00:22:26.923 --> 00:22:28.082
Not exactly.

00:22:28.523 --> 00:22:29.763
Your palm strike

00:22:29.882 --> 00:22:31.162
combined our inner energies

00:22:31.912 --> 00:22:33.723
and unblocked my Ren and Du meridians.

00:22:34.243 --> 00:22:34.723
The poison

00:22:35.642 --> 00:22:36.882
has been forced out.

00:22:38.162 --> 00:22:39.082
Even so,

00:22:39.923 --> 00:22:41.122
your martial prowess is gone.

00:22:45.483 --> 00:22:46.162
My inner energy.

00:22:54.122 --> 00:22:56.082
I put Dispersing Powder on my chest.

00:22:56.963 --> 00:22:58.162
You got poisoned

00:22:58.683 --> 00:22:59.842
when you struck me.

00:23:00.562 --> 00:23:01.483
Shameless.

00:23:02.842 --> 00:23:05.003
Everyone knows about
the former Crown Prince.

00:23:05.443 --> 00:23:07.402
You barely married into the family

00:23:07.842 --> 00:23:09.283
and can't wait to hold a funeral.

00:23:10.203 --> 00:23:11.362
Isn't this inappropriate?

00:23:12.923 --> 00:23:14.963
Why don't you work with me to find

00:23:15.443 --> 00:23:16.602
the former Crown Prince?

00:23:18.683 --> 00:23:19.923
Empty promises sound sweet.

00:23:20.443 --> 00:23:21.283
You simply

00:23:21.443 --> 00:23:23.003
want to steal credit from us.

00:23:45.402 --> 00:23:46.283
What's that smell?

00:23:50.728 --> 00:23:52.283
