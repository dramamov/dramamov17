00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.640
(Year Jia Chen, Month Xin Wei, 23rd Day)

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.079
(Shi Nan, the late emperor,
indulged in extravagance,)

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:01.240
(ruling with cruelty,)

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.000
(which sparked the Pingxiang rebellion.)

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.159
Assassin! After them!

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.599
Where were you?

00:01:16.256 --> 00:01:17.504
Why did you come to my chamber?

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.519
I thought you were...

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.280
I just don't want to see

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.879
more people die because of me.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.000
An assassin is in Archives Room.

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:29.560
Someone saw him here.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.200

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.000
Your Majesty.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.000
Get out now!

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.432
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.960
They're still here.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.479
You...

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.479
D-Did you find anything?

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:34.800
I went to the Archives Room

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.039
for the records of Pingxiang rebellion.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.280
(Mingqian General Gao Ji
turned the tide.)

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.439
(Without bloodshed,)

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:42.879
(he quelled Pingxiang rebellion.)

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.879
(He was thus entitled Prince Regent.)

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:46.639
(Then divine retribution came,)

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.280
(flooding Pingxiang completely.)

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.039
And the imperial rescript

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:52.199
was also forged.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.800
Now you believe me, don't you?

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.800
Report.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.879
No sign of the assassin.

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:23.759
You saw clearly?

00:03:24.224 --> 00:03:25.760
He really fled this way?

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.872
What will you do

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.479
next?

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.439
If you still choose cowardly survival,

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.199
I won't hesitate

00:03:40.576 --> 00:03:41.760
to end you swiftly.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.400
End...

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.319
Swiftly...

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:51.240
You won't blame me this time, will you?

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:56.240
They're gone.

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:08.680
It's getting late.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.439
I need to rest.

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:16.519
I said

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:17.824
I need to rest.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.560
Dress me properly.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.160
What?

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.279
You're my waiting maid.

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:36.199
So just dress me.

00:04:37.056 --> 00:04:38.624
And wasn't it you who undressed me?

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:51.360
Done.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.839
What kind of mess is this dressing?

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.632
How does she have that?

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:30.279
What's wrong, Shi Yu?

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.800
The Royal Tutor found
my private journal recently.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.279
He called me ignorant

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.079
and even read it aloud publicly.

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:41.399
Everyone mocked me.

00:05:41.824 --> 00:05:42.560
You were right.

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:44.079
He shouldn't have done that.

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:47.319
Do you have any way to keep them secret?

00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:50.879
Let's create a cipher, okay?

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:52.319
Okay.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:56.759
Someone.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.079
Needle and thread.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.839
Yes.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.000
(First watch of the Hai hour.
Cold Palace Wing.)

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:51.199
How do you recognize this cipher?

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:54.240
Why are you here?

00:06:58.759 --> 00:06:59.639
You also know it?

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:01.480
My brother and I

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:03.439
created this cipher years ago.

00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:06.079
Who are you contacting?

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.279
Your brother?

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:09.680
You mean

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:11.360
the late Emperor Shi Nan?

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:13.360
Back then,

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:15.959
under Gao Ji's coercion,

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:18.000
I personally shot my brother dead.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.376
(Eight Years Earlier)

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:40.560
Now if you loose this arrow,

00:07:40.959 --> 00:07:43.800
the Pingxiang rebellion can be solved.

00:07:47.439 --> 00:07:48.800
Thus, the realm

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.279
will know peace.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:04.800
Shi Yu,

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.160
you're different from your brother.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.560
His tyranny

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.519
caused the Pingxiang rebellion.

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:12.439
But you

00:08:12.439 --> 00:08:14.480
are compassionate and revered.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.680
The people of Pingxiang have chosen you
as the new Emperor.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.040
Will you choose your brother

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.864
or lasting peace?

00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:31.072
I choose peace.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.696
I'm your brother!

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:42.200
Actually, I went to investigate
his tomb later.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.120
It was empty.

00:08:44.759 --> 00:08:45.600
All these years,

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.039
I've been thinking

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:49.240
whether he might still be alive.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.279
Back then,

00:08:51.399 --> 00:08:53.200
people in Pingxiang
raised arms in defiance

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.240
against Shi Nan's rule,

00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:55.759
only to be used by Gao Ji.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.568
If Shi Nan is hiding in our place,

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:58.759
it's...

00:09:00.799 --> 00:09:01.480
It's impossible.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.399
(As for Pingxiang rebellion,)

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.064
(the Prince Regent Gao Ji
might be the real culprit.)

00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:25.600
Our plan to use Cheng Ge
to kill Shi Yu has failed.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.704
Ultimately,
it's about eliminating Shi Yu

00:09:28.704 --> 00:09:29.799
to rebuild our empire.

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:33.159
Let's take a more direct approach.

00:09:34.159 --> 00:09:34.720
Master,

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.320
this plan is too risky.

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:38.519
The Cheng Ge connection

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:40.000
was hard-earned.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.080
If we act recklessly,

00:09:41.639 --> 00:09:42.919
wouldn't that tip him off?

00:09:43.759 --> 00:09:45.759
How much longer must I wait?
