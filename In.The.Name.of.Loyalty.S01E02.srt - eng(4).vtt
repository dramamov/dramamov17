=Episode 2=

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:45.280
Your Majesty.

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:49.079
Your Majesty, it's me.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.200
Your Majesty.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.679
Get up. Get up now.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.479
Your Majesty.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.840
Your Majesty,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
the Prince Regent offers tea.

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:16.200
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:18.480
Don't do this. This is improper.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.840
Hand it to me.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.040
Your Majesty.

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.079
No need to attend tonight.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.480
You may leave.

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:55.079
Your Majesty.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.840
Every single garment here

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.920
must be safeguarded meticulously.

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.400
If any piece is damaged,

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.039
not even your severed head
could compensate.

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:13.080
Yes.

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:50.360
There's one more thing
I must remind you.

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:52.159
In this palace,

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.919
you just focus on your own duties.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.479
If you witness other matters

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:00.520
or overhear something,

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.599
pretend to be blind and deaf.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.000
Otherwise, even all your family's lives

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.680
won't suffice for the punishment.

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:18.560
Understood.

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:21.280
Return to your tasks.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.520
The traitors have been eliminated.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.759
Your Majesty,

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.360
you may rest now.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.240
(Concerning tonight's event,)

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.800
(why does the Prince Regent
seem more like the Emperor?)

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:51.800
(If that's true,)

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.199
(was the Emperor's behavior)

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.919
(in the bathhouse)

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:57.639
(also an act?)

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.960
(Forget it.)

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:11.439
(Factional conflicts aren't my concern.)

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.439
(I must find a chance to act.)

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:57.519
So cold.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.519
So cold.

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:23.600
(This is)

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:25.519
(the Frost Poison?)

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.279
Your Majesty.

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:29.439
Your Majesty.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.600
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:39.120
I feel cold.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.639
I feel cold.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.399
Your Majesty! Hurry, drink it.

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:43.519
You'll be fine.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.319
No. I can't drink it.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.759
What're you waiting for?

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:49.879
Help me lift His Majesty.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.160
Yes.

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:54.000
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:54.959
Come on.

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.480
Your Majesty, drink it now.

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:10.800
You may leave.

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:27.959
Your Majesty.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.120
It was so dangerous,

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:31.399
and you suffered much.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.879
Why didn't you drink it?

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.120
The tea

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.720
was bought with the blood
of fallen soldiers.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.639
How could I drink it?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.680
But

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.759
if you don't drink it, you'll die.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.600
Now,

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.839
officials I trusted

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.079
have all been killed by Gao Ji.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.759
How can I continue living like this?

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.600
Your Majesty, don't speak this way.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.120
(It seems the tea can)

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.639
(prolong onset of the Frost Poison.)

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.560
(But why would the Prince Regent
offer it to him?)

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:06.439
Waiting maid, receive the new garments.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:12.759
Thank you.

00:07:36.618 --> 00:07:39.808
(How are things in the palace)

00:07:41.888 --> 00:07:43.328
(Imperial Weaving House)

00:07:47.079 --> 00:07:47.639
Master.

00:08:06.759 --> 00:08:09.879
(In place, waiting for the right moment)
The Wardrobe Bureau's plan works.

00:08:11.439 --> 00:08:13.439
Master, you're brilliant.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.439
I never imagined we'd have

00:08:15.439 --> 00:08:16.800
our own people within the palace.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.480
Now we await Cheng Ge's success

00:08:21.399 --> 00:08:23.040
to achieve our grand ambition.

00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:32.080
(I'd better act swiftly.)

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:34.840
(If the Prince Regent is also involved,)

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:36.759
(I'll simply kill him as well.)

00:08:37.639 --> 00:08:39.320
(Why should I pity
that wretched Emperor?)

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.919
You're Cheng Ge?

00:08:50.879 --> 00:08:51.440
Yes, I am.

00:08:52.919 --> 00:08:53.559
Take her away.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:54.919
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:08:57.159 --> 00:08:59.480
The Empress has arrived.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.759
You visit late at night.
What's the matter?

00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:03.879
I haven't seen you these days.

00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:05.799
Since you don't come to my chamber,

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.759
I have to come here to see you.

00:09:09.559 --> 00:09:10.519
You've seen me now.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:11.679
You may leave.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:13.840
Well,

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.759
I refuse to comply.

00:09:16.879 --> 00:09:18.320
I'm not leaving today.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.159
What can you do to me?

00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:21.024
You...

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.600
I heard you've acquired
a new waiting maid.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.279
They say her serving skills
are exceptional.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.399
What do you want?

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.679
Speak plainly.

00:09:30.679 --> 00:09:32.120
Bring that waiting maid here

00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:33.720
to attend to His Majesty.

00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:39.840
Which hand touched His Majesty

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.960
during yesterday's bath?

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:43.840
No.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.200
I didn't.

00:09:45.639 --> 00:09:46.720
I wouldn't dare.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.360
No.

00:09:47.679 --> 00:09:49.159
I truly wouldn't dare.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.320
The Prince Regent has arrived.

00:09:55.399 --> 00:09:55.808
Ji.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.360
Take her away.

00:09:57.799 --> 00:09:58.399
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:09:59.519 --> 00:09:59.919
Go.

00:10:01.679 --> 00:10:03.000
What are you doing, Ji?

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.279
I'm still angry.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.159
You've been married
to Shi Yu for so long.

00:10:07.759 --> 00:10:08.759
He barely touched you,

00:10:08.759 --> 00:10:10.600
let alone having a royal heir.

00:10:15.639 --> 00:10:16.200
Listen well.

00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:18.720
Even that new waiting maid

00:10:20.759 --> 00:10:21.720
got more favor than you.

00:10:25.399 --> 00:10:26.519
What waiting maid?

00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:35.200
I wish to see

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.480
and learn properly,

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.200
so that in the future,

00:10:38.679 --> 00:10:40.320
I can help dress you as well.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:41.759
Gao Zhiying!

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.039
That's enough!

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.120
Very well.

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:49.720
Since His Majesty
won't demonstrate personally,

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.919
you shall dress me instead.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.639
You're hurting me!

00:11:07.799 --> 00:11:09.759
You're hiding as a waiting maid.

00:11:10.039 --> 00:11:11.399
Never reveal your martial skills.

00:11:15.879 --> 00:11:17.159
You lowly maid!

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.200
How dare you block me?

00:11:23.039 --> 00:11:24.120
You're avoiding me?

00:11:28.039 --> 00:11:29.039
You lowly maid!

00:11:30.519 --> 00:11:31.200
Stop!

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:32.039
Strike!

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.039
Your Majesty, must you protect
this lowly maid

00:11:38.039 --> 00:11:39.120
all along?

00:11:39.559 --> 00:11:40.720
It's between us.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.120
Don't involve the innocent.

00:11:44.159 --> 00:11:45.399
Innocent?

00:11:46.519 --> 00:11:47.279
Today,

00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:48.360
I will definitely

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.159
kill this wicked maid!

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:53.639
(Oh, no.)

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.080
Gao Zhiying,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
haven't you and you brother
done enough harm?

00:12:05.039 --> 00:12:05.679
Shall I

00:12:06.519 --> 00:12:07.759
give you my life too?

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.039
Let's go.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.200
Everyone, leave!

00:12:25.559 --> 00:12:26.240
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:12:30.159 --> 00:12:30.879
Waiting maid,

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.120
come here.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.279
