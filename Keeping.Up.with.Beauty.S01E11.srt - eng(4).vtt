00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.880
After all, General isn't the real Fu Yunyun.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.320
There's no need to stay at the Gu family,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.719
wasting time with those two brothers.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.319
It's better to divorce Gu Chenyu early.

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:07.760
- I'll help you find a place to live.
- Yunyun.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.560
Gu Chenyu.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.079
Why are you here?

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.599
You're a celebrity.

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:16.519
Someone took photos of you
and posted them online.

00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:22.640
I'll take you home.

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:23.560
Sorry.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.000
I…

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:26.239
It was my oversight.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.120
It's not your fault.

00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:30.480
Next time, you can come directly
to the Gu family to find me.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.200
That way, no one can
secretly take photos of you.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.480
I…

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.280
Sure.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.480
Anyway, today we have
Mr. Gu protecting us.

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:39.359
Let's just finish this meal properly.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.599
Mr. Gu,

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:42.680
you won't be stingy, right?

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:45.079
Sure.

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:46.920
I haven't eaten yet anyway.

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:51.599
Let's eat.

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.200
I'm curious.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.519
When did you guys first meet?

00:01:58.519 --> 00:02:00.959
That was a long time ago.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.920
I'm afraid telling you might scare you.

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:04.359
Yes.

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.000
Muyan is an old friend
I haven't seen for years.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.080
After a long time apart,

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.680
we had so much to say to each other.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.919
Mr. Gu,

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.560
could you give us some space?

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.439
The wound hurts again?

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.800
But I haven't eaten yet.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.000
I'm really hungry.

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:40.560
So,

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.479
what do you want to eat?

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:43.360
I'll help you.

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.919
This one.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.759
Okay.

00:02:58.639 --> 00:02:59.479
And this one.

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:00.319
Okay.

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:06.280
Eat slowly, don't choke.

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:16.479
Yunyun.

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:18.400
I've found a solution.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.639
Within three days,

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:21.680
I will become the head of the Gu family.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.000
What solution?

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.240
There are outsiders here.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.159
Let's talk at home.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.479
Then

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.080
congratulations in advance, Mr. Gu.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.400
(What are they doing?)

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.599
(Green tea guy.)

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.319
(Cunning dog.)

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:06.919
I just discharged.

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:07.960
Cannot drink.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.759
What are you thinking?

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:29.000
You seem distracted.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.360
Meeting an old friend in a foreign land

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:35.399
always brings back memories of the past.

00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:37.759
Do you guys

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.439
have a past together?

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:41.560
Yes.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.399
We once fought side by side,

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:45.600
through life and death.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.879
Those past days

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.680
are unforgettable for me.

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.639
Fighting side by side,
through life and death.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.879
We also have that.

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:01.879
This time I was kidnapped,

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:03.439
you risked everything to save me.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.800
I will always remember this favor.

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:09.879
So you mean

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.839
you took that blow for me

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.959
to repay my debt?

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.759
I…

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.360
I didn't think that far at the time.

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:20.079
I just wanted to protect you.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.399
Yunyun.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.319
I used to think I knew you very well.

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:31.199
But actually,

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:33.800
there are many things I don't know.

00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:35.279
I regret it.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.600
I can't be part of your past anymore.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.199
But from now on, everything you do,

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.439
every decision you want to make,

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:49.879
I'm willing to be with you.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.959
I…

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:13.959
I think I'm a little drunk.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.120
I now own 37% of the group's shares,

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.600
1% more than you,

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.439
still the largest shareholder
of the group.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.540
(Gu Group Share Transfer Agreement)

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.460
(Transferee: Gu Chenyu)

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.879
So,

00:07:09.519 --> 00:07:11.360
you've been buying up
these scattered shares all along.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.800
But,

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.279
I am the CEO approved by the board,

00:07:18.519 --> 00:07:20.279
my one-year term has already begun.

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:22.800
Chenyu,

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.639
although

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:28.519
you are now the largest shareholder,

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.560
still,

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.199
I might have to trouble you

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.240
to try and secure next year.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.959
If you resign voluntarily,

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.639
the board will appoint a new CEO.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.560
Why should I resign?

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.279
The last time I was kidnapped,

00:07:51.519 --> 00:07:53.279
was done by your mother,
Bai Lanxing, right?

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.360
The evidence is all on this drive.

00:07:56.399 --> 00:07:58.040
I can give it to the police,

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.759
or I can give it to you.

00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:02.199
If you act voluntarily,

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:04.079
give up the head of the family position,

00:08:04.279 --> 00:08:05.399
I can let her go.

00:08:05.959 --> 00:08:07.399
Everything would be settled.

00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:17.959
You're threatening me.

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:22.160
I've already made it very clear.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.639
The choice is yours.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.559
I won't just give up like that.

00:08:49.759 --> 00:08:51.000
A little souvenir.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:56.720
Miss,

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.200
the hotel restaurant
has a new menu recently.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.279
All the dishes you liked
since childhood.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.759
Lamb rolls just flown in
from Inner Mongolia,

00:09:03.759 --> 00:09:05.679
and seafood just caught today.

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:06.720
You must try them.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.279
Uncle Wang,

00:09:08.679 --> 00:09:10.200
since you returned as vice president,

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.759
the business and atmosphere
at Jiangxing have improved a lot.

00:09:12.759 --> 00:09:15.000
Jiangxing is finally back on track.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.080
We also have to thank you, Miss.

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.200
If you want to thank anyone,

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.360
thank Gu Chenyu.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.399
He drove away Mr. Liu

00:09:21.399 --> 00:09:23.519
and returned Jiangxing
to your management,

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.039
and saved the jobs of so many
long-time employees.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.200
Thank him?

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.320
Who knows if he suddenly
had a conscience

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.679
or had ulterior motives?

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:31.840
Uncle Wang,

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.679
there's currently no evidence linking

00:09:33.679 --> 00:09:35.360
my dad's matter to Gu Chenyu.

00:09:35.759 --> 00:09:37.600
Everything is just our speculation.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.360
Maybe we should be a bit less
biased against him.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:41.440
But...

00:09:41.919 --> 00:09:42.480
Miss.

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:45.279
You look much healthier now.

00:09:45.279 --> 00:09:46.600
Have you adapted to the security work?

00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:48.080
Completely adapted.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.399
Thanks to Mr. Gu
for forgiving my mistakes

00:09:50.639 --> 00:09:51.759
and giving me this chance.

00:09:53.039 --> 00:09:54.600
Is Mr. Gu's arm better now?

00:09:54.799 --> 00:09:55.600
Earlier,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.879
I misunderstood him.

00:09:57.879 --> 00:09:58.600
Miss,

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.080
when you see him,

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.200
please apologize on my behalf.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.279
Thank him properly for me.

00:10:05.679 --> 00:10:06.279
Mr. Gu

00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:07.480
is really a good person.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.080
Don't worry, Miss.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:10.600
From now on,

00:10:10.759 --> 00:10:12.200
I'll work diligently here.

00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:13.879
I'll treat Jiangxing as my own home.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:14.480
Good.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.799
I'll be leaving now.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.039
You go ahead.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.279
Take care of yourself.

00:10:19.559 --> 00:10:20.080
Okay.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.960
Miss,

00:10:24.639 --> 00:10:27.039
I'm temporarily retracting
my judgment of Gu Chenyu.

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:27.679
But,

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.679
if he harms Jiangxing,

00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:30.519
or harms you,

00:10:30.519 --> 00:10:31.480
I will never let him go.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.519
Rest assured.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:33.440
Also,

00:10:33.639 --> 00:10:35.919
I will continue to investigate
my dad's matter.

00:10:36.159 --> 00:10:37.279
What you need to do now

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:38.759
is to manage Jiangxing well.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.919
Jiangxing is my dad's lifetime effort.

00:10:40.919 --> 00:10:41.639
We

00:10:41.639 --> 00:10:43.559
must preserve this prestigious brand.

00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:44.200
Okay.

00:10:44.919 --> 00:10:46.360
But Miss,

00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:49.559
Gu Chenyu is now the head
of the Gu family.

00:10:49.559 --> 00:10:51.240
So many eyes are on him outside.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.639

with him now?
