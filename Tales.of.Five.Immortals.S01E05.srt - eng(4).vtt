00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.400
A Magician

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.760
How could he be killed by his own act?

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.000
There was nothing unusual during the show.

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:17.560
Then something must've gone wrong with his trick.

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:26.640
I checked your props that day.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.000
Someone switched them.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.879
The fake knife was swapped for a real one.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.000
The rope was tampered with too.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.680
So this wasn't an accident at all.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.200
It was murder.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.280
Take it.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.439
Did you find anything?

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.560
I checked the Magician's props.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.480
Normally, in The Sawing Illusion,

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:51.959
the knives are always rigged.

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.040
Open the trick, use a real knife for watermelon.

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:57.480
Close it, use a fake knife for the head.

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:00.239
But his knife was switched.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.879
The fake knife was replaced with a real one.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.359
By the time he noticed,

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.480
it was too late.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.000
What?

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:09.639
The Magician's props are now evidence.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.680
They've been taken to the station.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.800
I'll verify your story right away.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.199
If you're lying,

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:17.599
I'll treat you as an accomplice.

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:19.400
But if I'm right,

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.240
I want to see

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.199
the body of Boss Hu

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.000
who "committed suicide" at the Nightclub.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.479
And also,

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.759
bring me the rope from the guillotine.

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.680
Officer.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.599
I'm thirsty.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.879
Sit tight and behave.

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:38.919
Go back.

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:44.000
You promised you'd come save me.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.800
It's been so long and you're still not here.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.000
He wouldn't just leave me, would he?

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.240
Boss Hu was a regular at the Nightclub.

00:02:58.919 --> 00:02:59.759
A week ago,

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.560
he was found hanged in the Nightclub.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.960
On the second floor railing.

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:06.080
People said

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:08.000
Boss Hu was swindled by the Japanese recently.

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:09.039
He lost a huge sum.

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:10.919
He'd been depressed for days.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.159
No sign of anyone else at the scene.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.520
We suspect it was suicide.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.840
Here's what you asked for.

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:28.719
The Magician's prop rope.

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:51.479
Look at this pattern—does it look familiar?

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.719
The patterns match.

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:01.039
How do you prove it's not a coincidence?

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.439
Officer Gu.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.000
I know a thing or two about magic.

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:11.080
Magicians usually use hemp rope.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.960
Normally, it's the cheapest kind.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.800
But this one's clearly specially treated.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.120
It's smoother.

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:18.680
And softer.

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:21.399
The killer must be sending us a message.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.079
Officer Gu.

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:25.000
Am I right?

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.720
You know the answer.

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:32.120
You're right.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.079
When I collected the evidence earlier,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.759
I compared them carefully.

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.199
The Magician's prop rope

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:41.959
and the rope Boss Hu was hanged with—

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.120
they're identical.

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:58.079
Officer Gu.

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:04.120
Look.

00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:10.120
These are two pieces of the same rope.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.959
Boss Hu was murdered.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.920
The killer left us a clue.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.959
So here's my suggestion.

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:17.800
Let's play along.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.959
Let me go back to the Nightclub and investigate.

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:26.160
You...

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:27.759
You're getting more interesting.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.560
Want to stay and help me?

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:33.120
These past few days,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.040
it's the Japanese Commander of Ha City's birthday.

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:36.399
Most of our police force

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.879
is stationed at the commander's residence.

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:40.120
I haven't assigned many officers

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.480
to this case.

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:43.879
Officer Gu.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.759
If you trust me,

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.759
why not release Miss Bai first?

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.759
She's been with me these past two days.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.560
She only arrived in Ha City today.

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:53.240
She had no time to commit the crime.

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:55.160
With her here,

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.319
I'm sure I can solve the case.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.800
Do you know who I am?

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.680
Go! Let me go!

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.040
Why did you take so long to get here?

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:09.040
What did you find?

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:14.639
Isn't this Miss Bai from the Bai family?

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.160
Get the Bai family to pull some strings.

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:20.839
Then you could get out.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.160
I'm not the killer.

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:23.480
Why should I use connections?

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.920
Just be glad you have Laifu as a friend.

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:35.879
For Laifu's sake.

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:38.079
But Laifu,

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:41.040
I'll give you only three days to find the real killer.

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:43.279
Otherwise, Miss Bai

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:45.399
remains a suspect.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.759
You...

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.759
Actually,

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.800
You don't need to care about her fate.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.439
You're very capable.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.920
You could stay and help me.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.759
I could hire you as a special advisor.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.000
It's much better than

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:05.920
just being her sidekick.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.639
Officer Gu, you really know how to play.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.199
First a slap,

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.240
then a sweet treat.

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:11.600
Just a few tricks.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.720
I've got plenty of ways to handle suspects.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.319
I'm warning you—

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.240
he's with me.

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:18.360
Don't even think about recruiting him.

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:21.800
Let's see if you can keep him.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.240
My patience is limited.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.040
But the offer

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.480
stands for you.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.959
Thank you for your trust, Officer Gu.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.680
A guest is coming.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.680
Boss, we're closed.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:52.759
I know.

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:54.519
We're here to ask about something else.

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:57.160
You two—

00:07:57.399 --> 00:07:58.240
Yesterday, you two

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.240
made a mess of my place.

00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:00.800
What do you want today?

00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:05.519
The Bai family is investigating.

00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:09.319
They handle ghosts and spirits.

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:11.480
But I've never heard they deal with people.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.240
We're not here for nothing.

00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:21.759
Let's talk.

00:08:25.959 --> 00:08:29.279
Ladies, time to get to work!

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.320
Who did Boss Hu meet before he died?

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.159
Me, me, me.

00:08:48.639 --> 00:08:49.879
After he left my room,

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.159
he died right after.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.919
I really don't know anything.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.840
Did Boss Hu act strange that day?

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.799
Strange?

00:09:09.879 --> 00:09:12.480
He said his chest felt burning.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.440
I massaged his chest for him.

00:09:18.039 --> 00:09:19.320
The toast?

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:22.440
Come on, come on.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.159
Why is it so hot?

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.840
Let me cool you down, massage you.

00:09:32.919 --> 00:09:33.399
No.

00:09:35.679 --> 00:09:36.519
It's too stuffy.

00:09:38.559 --> 00:09:39.279
Move away.

00:09:41.679 --> 00:09:42.200
So hot.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:44.600
Boss Hu.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.240
Ziyan.

00:10:04.679 --> 00:10:05.480
Ziyan.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.320
Ziyan is already dead.

00:10:10.799 --> 00:10:13.639
The girls all say Ziyan never left.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.840
She's still in this nightclub.

00:10:16.159 --> 00:10:17.919
So when did Ziyan die?

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.080
How did she die?

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.799
Just last month.

00:10:26.039 --> 00:10:29.039
That little witch used her youth

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.679
to steal other people's men.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.039
She's a real seductress.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.879
Darn it.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.159
Tell me the details.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.519
What's there to say?

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.559
Women like us,

00:10:45.879 --> 00:10:47.840
we either die of disease

00:10:48.159 --> 00:10:49.720
or at the hands of men.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.639
Who knows what illness she had?

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.559
She couldn't take it and hanged herself.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.759
Just like Boss Hu, both hanged.

00:11:11.919 --> 00:11:13.080
I don't know about that.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.320
You should ask them.

00:11:15.039 --> 00:11:15.559
You.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:29.960
Don't be scared, everyone.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.039
Mr. Lin is taking me out for dinner soon.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.720
I'm going to touch up my makeup.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.639
I'll use the restroom first.

00:11:40.879 --> 00:11:42.039
You all keep chatting.

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:43.600
We have to go practice our dance.

00:11:43.679 --> 00:11:44.120
Let's go, let's go.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.720
Yes, yes, we're going to fix our makeup.

00:11:45.799 --> 00:11:46.639
Sit for a bit first.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.840
Well, that's just great.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.039
None of them want to cooperate.

00:11:52.679 --> 00:11:54.080
We can only wait and see.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:56.960
It's all your fault.

00:11:57.399 --> 00:11:58.200
I spent all my money,

00:11:58.279 --> 00:11:59.240
and got nothing out of it.

00:11:59.799 --> 00:12:00.679
Give me my money back.

00:12:01.039 --> 00:12:01.559
No.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.639
Aren't we investigating together?

00:12:10.919 --> 00:12:11.960
They're already dead.

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:13.399
What's the point of asking?

00:12:23.559 --> 00:12:24.360
Ziyan...

00:12:24.559 --> 00:12:25.840
Every grudge has its source.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.039
I have no quarrel with you.

00:12:27.159 --> 00:12:28.480
Please, don't come looking for me.

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:29.120
Ziyan.

00:12:39.519 --> 00:12:40.080
Who?

00:12:41.039 --> 00:12:41.759
Who's there?

00:13:21.639 --> 00:13:22.960
Probably just a rat.

00:13:26.559 --> 00:13:28.000
I'll get a cat tomorrow.

00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:31.519
Let's see what tricks you try then.

00:13:49.279 --> 00:13:49.799
Go take a look.

00:13:52.639 --> 00:13:53.279
It's haunted.

00:13:53.679 --> 00:13:54.679
It's haunted.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.440
Be your bride.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:02.759
Break a willow branch.

00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:05.879
Stay by your side.

00:14:05.879 --> 00:14:06.840
It's Ziyan.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.600
Ziyan has come for me.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:09.720
It's Ziyan.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.919
It's Ziyan's ghost.
