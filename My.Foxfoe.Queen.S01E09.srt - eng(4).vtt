00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.580
(He's sweating.)

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.020
(Could it be...)

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.940
There is actually a crack.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.539
Looks like if I want to melt the ice,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.260
I'll have to kiss his lips.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.540
(I must find another chance
to kiss him again.)

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.220
Your Majesty.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.379
As you commanded,

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.819
all the relief supplies were
distributed to the victims

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.420
under Her Highness's name.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.379
Send more men.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.979
Protect the Empress in secret.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.379
Don't let her face any danger.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.260
Yes.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.380
I heard

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.540
that Lord Yi went along as well.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.860
Keep a close watch on him.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.100
Do not let him act inappropriately
toward the Empress.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.060
A scout reported

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.140
that Lord Yi and the Empress seem to be

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.620
a little entangled.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.899
Liusu,

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.939
the roast chicken you brought
is so plump.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:11.940
Right?

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.259
Kids,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.779
look here.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.179
This is my favorite roast chicken.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.419
Who wants a bite?

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.499
Me!

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.499
All of you want some, huh?

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.260
I'll share it with you, then.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.500
Wonderful!

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.019
Here, one for you.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.540
Hold it carefully.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.700
Here.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.820
Take this one.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.339
You get a big one.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.460
Here.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.139
Take it.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.460
Hold it tight.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.019
Here.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.980
One for you.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.500
Take it.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.260
Who else wants some?

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.980
Sir.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.579
We got one for you.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.699
Don't give him any.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.019
He's a bad guy!

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.220
He always bullies the miss.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.379
Let's go.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.940
Alright.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.340
Kids, listen to me.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.619
Do you want to play

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.699
the game "Eagle Catches the Chicks"?

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.219
Yes!

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.179
Then, I'll be the eagle.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.979
Who wants to be the mother hen?

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.979
Do you want to be the hen?

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.460
Or...

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.260
How about that guy over there?

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.979
- Let him be the mother hen.
- Yes!

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.340
Go get him!

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:42.660
Mother hen!

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.699
Here comes the mother hen!

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.620
We brought the mother hen here!

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.220
Let's line up!

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.459
Come on.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.420
Stand in front of me.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.060
Stay in position.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.299
Stand still.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.739
Are you all lined up?

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.419
The eagle's about to come catch you!

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.259
We're ready!

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.899
Mother hen, protect us!

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.499
We're not scared!

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.499
Now,

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.620
the eagle's coming to catch you!

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.180
Here I come!

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.380
Don't run!

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.100
Don't run!

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.660
Stop running!

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.820
Where did you go?

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.900
Stop running!

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.260
(They're finally
willing to play with me.)

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.820
(Thank you,)

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.060
(Yue.)

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.780
(It's now or never.)

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.500
The eagle caught the mother hen!

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.500
Yue...

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.060
(How does he know my name?)

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.460
(Could he be...)

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.260
(Yaya...)

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.779
Run, everyone!

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.139
He's going to kill someone!

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.299
What's happening?

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.939
No way!

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:17.659
Could this be

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.220
some kind of new game?

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.819
Run!

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.219
Hey, did you notice?

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.779
Why are his eyes red?

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:32.619
Did you see that?

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.299
Is he really about to kill someone?

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.819
Run!

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.020
Run!

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.300
Xin'er.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.300
I'll let you see for yourself
how terrifying Xiling Xuan really is.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.100
Then, maybe you'll stop
letting him get close to you.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.020
Madam Zhang.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.339
Don't come any closer!

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.820
Stay back!

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.619
(I must've heard it wrong.)

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.539
(This vile demon)

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.220
(can't be Yaya.)

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:25.699
Stay away from me!

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.340
Stay away from me!

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.499
Stop it, you bully!

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.220
Don't hurt my mother!

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.300
Niu!

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.420
Niu!

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.939
What's this? It looks so pretty.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.139
It's a lucky bird I wove for you.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.339
It'll bless you with good health
and good fortune.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.860
May you stay safe and well.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.620
Lord Yi.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.780
I lost control again.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:00.700
Help them!
