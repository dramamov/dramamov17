00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.200
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.759
No need.

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.600
Since you've allied with me,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.679
when there's no one else,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.079
I can handle

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.359
the dressing myself.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.759
You haven't

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:58.960
promised me one thing.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.079
What's it?

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.799
The people of Pingxiang

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:05.560
were kind

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.079
and simple.

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:10.840
They worked from dawn

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.319
until dusk,

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:17.599
only seeking peaceful lives

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:20.120
and praying for their children's
safe growth.

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:24.359
Yet in the end,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.280
they all died unjustly.

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:30.159
If one day,

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.879
I'm also gone,

00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:34.280
you must

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:36.799
avenge Pingxiang's people for me.

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:38.400
Didn't I tell you?

00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:40.120
With me here,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.200
I'll ensure your safety.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.519
Promise me first.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.079
I promise.

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:52.120
Oh, right.

00:01:53.184 --> 00:01:53.680
This...

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:56.920
The court

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:58.280
is full of schemes.

00:01:59.159 --> 00:01:59.719
Here's a list

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.040
of key court officials.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.480
All these years,

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:05.680
my image as a tyrannical ruler

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:07.480
has been well-established.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.039
To overthrow Gao Ji,

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.360
we must dismantle his power
step by step.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.240
I already have a general strategy.

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:17.120
You seek

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:18.719
to win hearts first

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.159
and secure power?

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.639
Exactly.

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:35.599
(It seems like I've)

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.319
(not much time left.)

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.080
I have been

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:45.319
in the palace for long.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.199
I suddenly miss the life
outside the palace.

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:50.080
I want

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.039
to go out and see.

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:53.879
Go out and see?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.039
It doesn't sound like you.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.199
Are you perhaps tired lately
and want to go for a walk?

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:04.520
Just one day.

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:06.599
Only this single day.

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:18.240
Great!

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.639
How is it?

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:24.879
It's dull in the palace all day.

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:27.240
The outside is more fun.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.840
Our sudden departure

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:33.039
will likely make Gao Ji suspicious.

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:36.719
I think right now,

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.039
he's already sent people to watch me.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.400
Watch out!

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:54.159
Don't move.

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:23.040
Beautiful.

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:42.759
Lanterns!

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.040
Beautiful lanterns here!

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.199
Look at that lantern.

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:47.800
It's quite nice.

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:51.680
You like lanterns?

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:56.079
Let's go. I'll take you somewhere.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.439
Sir, look at my lanterns.

00:04:58.959 --> 00:04:59.680
Take your pick.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.560
Sorry. Coming through.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.480
Excuse me. Sorry.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.079
Excuse me.

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.680
Thank you.

00:05:05.216 --> 00:05:05.680
How is it?

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:07.600
You can paint whatever you like.

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:11.560
I didn't expect you to know this,
as you stay in the palace all day.

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:13.040
Of course.

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:15.360
As the tyrannical

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.480
Emperor,

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.040
I must excel in indulgence.

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:22.240
Follow me.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.319
When the dark line
reaches the Quchi acupoint,

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.800
without the antidote,

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.120
no one can save you.

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:11.319
I've already finished painting.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.879
Why haven't you started?

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.040
I don't know how to paint.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.399
What will you paint?

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:21.639
Let me teach you.

00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:25.439
I haven't decided yet.

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:33.399
Well...

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:35.399
Your grip on the brush is wrong.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.839
Hold it like this.

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:38.879
Don't let it shake.

00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:39.879
Keep it steady.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.319
When you make a stroke,

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.759
be decisive.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.040
Like this.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.519
Again, like this.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.360
And like this.

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:06.240
I've got it.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.000
I'll draw it myself.

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:22.439
We can't go on

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:23.800
like this.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.040
We must find a way

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:27.519
to shake them off.

00:07:29.519 --> 00:07:30.319
How?

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:40.959
Let's run!

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.399
Try this.

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:02.399
This is the finest wine

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.480
in the capital.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.439
You're finally useful.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.399
Your smile is quite beautiful.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.040
You should smile more.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.120
Since childhood,

00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:28.519
I've lived with hatred,

00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:30.120
never daring to forget.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.600
How could I smile?

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.120
If you like it,

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.000
I can often bring you out to relax.

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:48.360
If we succeed in killing Gao Ji,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.080
what will you want most afterward?

00:09:05.919 --> 00:09:07.519
If my brother were still alive,

00:09:08.679 --> 00:09:09.519
I would find him

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.879
and let him take the throne.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.799
Countless people through history

00:09:18.039 --> 00:09:19.360
have fought bloodily

00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:21.399
over this throne.

00:09:22.679 --> 00:09:24.080
Yet you want to let him take it?

00:09:25.639 --> 00:09:27.000
I want to escape court intrigues.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.480
I want

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.960
to become truly free.

00:09:32.159 --> 00:09:32.879
I also want

00:09:35.679 --> 00:09:36.519
to brew pine wine

00:09:37.919 --> 00:09:39.000
and make tea in spring

00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:40.799
with the one I love.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.799
What were you drawing earlier?

00:10:10.639 --> 00:10:11.440
- Great!
- Great!

00:10:12.919 --> 00:10:13.720
- Great!
- Great!

00:10:16.039 --> 00:10:16.840
- Great!
- Great!

00:10:20.879 --> 00:10:21.440
- Great!
- Great!

00:11:19.456 --> 00:11:22.400
