Chenyu.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:05.480
Chenyu!

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.079
Look.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.400
Zhao Muyan met with Yunyun in private!

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.680
The enemy is already at our doorstep,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.799
if you don't take action soon,

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.400
Yunyun will be taken away
by someone else.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.599
She said she chose me.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.879
That was then, this is now, Chenyu.

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:22.359
Zhao Muyan is a big celebrity.

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:25.079
He's handsome and knows how to talk.

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:27.120
He can win a girl's heart
in a few words.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.359
I'm even his fan.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.480
You want to date him?

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.120
No.

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:33.159
Chenyu,

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.599
you still have your advantages.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.920
Such as?

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.280
For example, you're richer than him.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.640
Wealthier than him.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.719
And more...

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.959
More prosperous than him.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.799
Prosperous.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.480
Are those three any different?

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:52.879
Anyway,

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:53.920
what I mean is,

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.400
you can't just sit and wait.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.120
You need to show Yunyun
your true feelings.

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.319
True feelings.

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:00.959
Yes, Mr. Gu.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.879
Flowing water doesn't rush to be first.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.159
It strives to flow endlessly.

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:34.400
Gu Chenyu.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.759
Why are you standing here?

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.080
I...

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:45.680
I...

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.360
I...

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.759
I'm waiting for you.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.159
Waiting for me?

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.000
Is something wrong?

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:03.800
I'd like to invite you somewhere
tomorrow night.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.590
(Gu Chenyu)
(I'll wait for you at the art gallery.)

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.599
Be careful, Mr. Gu.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:00.159
(Fu Yunyun
Personal Oil Painting Exhibition)

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:01.680
Slow down, watch your step.

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:27.839
If Ms. Fu knew

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:29.600
that you'd collected her old paintings

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.920
and organized this exhibition for her,

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:33.079
she would be very moved.

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:47.560
Do I look handsome?

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.920
Super handsome.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.720
You came, Yunyun.

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:08.360
I know you've loved painting
since you were a child.

00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:13.399
I thought
you might like this exhibition.

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:16.000
Let's go inside.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.279
Gu Chenyu,

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.360
I didn't come today to see
the exhibition with you.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.800
I received something.

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:30.600
There are some questions
I want to ask you.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.800
Get out!

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:33.120
Uncle Fu,

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.600
the financial situation
of Jiangxing Hotel is already serious.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.600
Please trust me.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.519
Give it to me,

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:39.160
I'll get you the best price

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.360
and help settle your debts.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.199
Bah!

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.120
Who needs your fake concern?

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.160
This was all a trap you planned!

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.319
From start to finish, you just
wanted to seize Jiangxing Hotel!

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:50.199
You misunderstand me.

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:51.480
I'm doing this for your sake.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.480
Our two families
have been close for so many years.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.519
And I thought
you were always steady and reliable.

00:05:57.519 --> 00:05:58.959
I never thought you'd be

00:05:58.959 --> 00:05:59.879
such a disappointment.

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:00.800
Uncle Fu, please listen to me...

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.920
Don't push me!

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:08.000
Even if I die,
I'll never hand Jiangxing over to you!

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.040
Uncle Fu!

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.600
Get out!

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.360
Uncle...

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.279
This is the security footage
from the corridor before my father died.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.800
He met you before his death

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.120
and had an argument with you.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.560
Why didn't you ever tell me about it?

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.480
I...

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:36.959
I never told you because...

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.199
because I was afraid you'd suspect me.

00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:43.959
Afraid you'd think
I had something to do with his death.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.120
But Uncle Fu's death wasn't my fault.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.079
I swear it wasn't.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.720
I checked the hotel's
surveillance footage from that day.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.560
I found that the footage
had been hacked.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.680
I couldn't find anything.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.480
Hacked?

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:54.959
Gu Chenyu.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.720
My father
couldn't have committed suicide.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.680
That morning he said
he'd come home for dinner.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.959
He promised to cook for me.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.480
Tell me, how could
he have killed himself?

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.319
You say you didn't kill him.

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:09.399
Then tell me,

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.319
who did?

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.720
That day...

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.360
That day, I did have
an argument with Uncle Fu.

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:21.360
I wanted to acquire Jiangxing.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.120
But he...

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.279
he refused me.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.879
He even kicked me out.

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:27.160
After that, I never went back.

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:28.160
And then...

00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:35.079
Third Uncle.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.199
I...

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:50.120
I...

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.490
Everything is just
too much of a coincidence.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.600
Jiangxing's cash flow broke down,

00:07:57.959 --> 00:07:58.959
my father was desperate,

00:07:58.959 --> 00:08:00.680
and you still forced him
to sell the hotel.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.319
I didn't.

00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:03.959
Then you conveniently
acquired Jiangxing afterward,

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.519
and became the CEO of Gu Group.

00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:08.000
No matter what,

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:11.399
my father's death is connected to you.

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:14.000
Yunyun.

00:08:15.519 --> 00:08:17.600
I really bought Jiangxing
out of good intentions.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.920
I never meant
to drive Uncle Fu to his death.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.759
If you want Jiangxing,

00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:21.920
I can return it to you anytime.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.600
If you still doubt Uncle Fu's death,
I'll help you investigate again...

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.199
No need.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.600
Gu Chenyu.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.799
Let's get a divorce.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.159
Yunyun.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:38.600
From now on,

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:41.360
we're completely done.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.600
No more ties between us.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:44.720
