00:01:44.757 --> 00:01:45.796
Mother.

00:01:46.596 --> 00:01:47.396
My face.

00:01:48.477 --> 00:01:49.036
My child.

00:01:49.357 --> 00:01:49.796
This...

00:01:53.596 --> 00:01:54.436
What happened?

00:01:54.557 --> 00:01:55.357
Ms. Wang.

00:01:55.796 --> 00:01:57.596
What did you put in the rouge

00:01:57.837 --> 00:01:59.277
you just presented to me?

00:01:59.637 --> 00:02:00.997
Your Highness, I'm innocent.

00:02:01.197 --> 00:02:02.077
That rouge

00:02:02.117 --> 00:02:03.596
was given to me by Mrs. Han.

00:02:03.876 --> 00:02:05.036
You all saw it, right?

00:02:05.316 --> 00:02:06.277
- Yes.
- You all saw it.

00:02:06.277 --> 00:02:08.477
Drag her away!

00:02:09.197 --> 00:02:10.357
Your Highness, listen to me.

00:02:10.676 --> 00:02:11.197
She did

00:02:11.437 --> 00:02:12.116
this on purpose.

00:02:12.396 --> 00:02:13.477
She knew everything.

00:02:13.637 --> 00:02:15.317
Your Highness, please spare me.

00:02:16.116 --> 00:02:18.037
The Han family conspired against me.

00:02:18.556 --> 00:02:19.917
Send them all to the Penal Bureau

00:02:20.437 --> 00:02:21.077
and execute.

00:02:21.477 --> 00:02:22.597
Your Highness, please.

00:02:23.688 --> 00:02:24.157
Let's go.

00:02:24.236 --> 00:02:24.796
Grand Tutor.

00:02:24.956 --> 00:02:25.877
Save me!

00:02:25.956 --> 00:02:26.556
Grand Tutor!

00:02:26.716 --> 00:02:27.317
Rest assured.

00:02:27.676 --> 00:02:29.077
I'll visit your graves next year.

00:02:32.396 --> 00:02:33.396
How terrifying!

00:02:33.597 --> 00:02:35.597
She poisoned someone here?

00:02:39.597 --> 00:02:40.357
I feel dizzy.

00:02:47.996 --> 00:02:48.477
Stepmother.

00:02:49.676 --> 00:02:50.157
Stepmother.

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:51.917
Stepmother, wake up!

00:02:52.116 --> 00:02:53.116
Stepmother, wake up!

00:02:53.796 --> 00:02:54.716
Wake up!

00:02:55.037 --> 00:02:55.477
Wake up!

00:02:55.556 --> 00:02:56.236
Xue Hexu.

00:02:56.996 --> 00:02:58.317
If you shake me one more time,

00:02:59.077 --> 00:03:00.437
I'll kill you brutally.

00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:05.437
Sir,

00:03:05.917 --> 00:03:07.197
she isn't feeling well.

00:03:07.396 --> 00:03:08.157
We're leaving.

00:03:08.716 --> 00:03:09.236
Hurry

00:03:09.437 --> 00:03:10.357
to take some rest.

00:03:10.796 --> 00:03:11.236
Let's go.

00:03:25.416 --> 00:03:27.528
(Jing'an Bureau)

00:03:27.917 --> 00:03:29.757
You are either a fool, or an imbecile,

00:03:29.877 --> 00:03:30.836
or you're both.

00:03:31.116 --> 00:03:32.040
This was your plan.

00:03:32.116 --> 00:03:33.477
Now the Princess's face is ruined.

00:03:33.477 --> 00:03:34.757
His Majesty might blame me.

00:03:34.996 --> 00:03:36.116
All expenses for the banquet

00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:37.352
is deducted from your salary.

00:03:51.643 --> 00:03:52.776
(Xue Street)

00:04:02.263 --> 00:04:03.528
(Xue Mansion)

00:04:04.197 --> 00:04:06.516
Why are these weaklings
of the Xue family

00:04:07.116 --> 00:04:08.437
so difficult to eliminate?

00:04:31.476 --> 00:04:32.117
Strip off.

00:04:33.677 --> 00:04:34.516
No way.

00:04:34.956 --> 00:04:36.836
Jiaoqian said I can't let anyone

00:04:36.916 --> 00:04:37.997
see my body.

00:04:40.757 --> 00:04:41.797
Strip off!

00:04:42.356 --> 00:04:43.396
What are you doing?

00:04:43.637 --> 00:04:44.396
Strip off!

00:04:44.396 --> 00:04:45.757
Why are you stripping me again?

00:04:52.916 --> 00:04:53.877
The former Crown Prince?

00:05:11.836 --> 00:05:12.317
I...

00:05:12.997 --> 00:05:13.596
Come on.

00:05:15.836 --> 00:05:16.916
(The clue is lost.)

00:05:17.356 --> 00:05:19.197
(I almost got set up
by Grand Tutor Zhou.)

00:05:20.036 --> 00:05:21.237
(If it weren't for him...)

00:05:23.476 --> 00:05:25.036
Didn't expect you to help me.

00:05:25.836 --> 00:05:26.916
I thought...

00:05:27.276 --> 00:05:28.557
I would harm you?

00:05:29.836 --> 00:05:30.997
I know you don't trust me

00:05:31.877 --> 00:05:32.956
and suspect we

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.437
harbor the former Crown Prince.

00:05:35.117 --> 00:05:35.916
But now,

00:05:36.437 --> 00:05:37.237
I won't harm you.

00:05:37.797 --> 00:05:39.156
Now we share honor

00:05:39.356 --> 00:05:40.077
and hardships.

00:05:41.156 --> 00:05:42.077
My goal is

00:05:42.396 --> 00:05:43.437
to protect the Xue family.

00:05:43.956 --> 00:05:44.757
I sincerely hope

00:05:44.757 --> 00:05:46.036
you can treat us as family.

00:05:49.237 --> 00:05:49.716
Jiaoqian.

00:05:52.276 --> 00:05:54.276
Anything to say about
what happened today?

00:05:54.696 --> 00:05:55.156
What?

00:05:55.877 --> 00:05:56.557
Nothing.

00:05:56.836 --> 00:05:58.596
I just threw away her dish.

00:05:58.956 --> 00:06:00.757
I don't know about the rest.

00:06:02.197 --> 00:06:03.237
I knew it's you!

00:06:06.916 --> 00:06:07.997
You did this on purpose.

00:06:08.797 --> 00:06:09.916
You two tricked me!

00:06:12.757 --> 00:06:13.237
Jiaoqian.

00:06:14.117 --> 00:06:15.637
All these years here,

00:06:15.797 --> 00:06:17.276
you've served Dongyang well.

00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:19.036
I know you didn't mean to.

00:06:20.077 --> 00:06:21.437
You must be fooled by someone.

00:06:21.916 --> 00:06:23.437
You didn't want

00:06:24.077 --> 00:06:25.596
to get Stepmother killed.

00:06:26.317 --> 00:06:28.396
That person must've told you

00:06:28.956 --> 00:06:30.916
to just drive her out of Xue Mansion,

00:06:31.396 --> 00:06:31.877
right?

00:06:32.237 --> 00:06:33.716
Gu Qianfu told me this.

00:06:34.237 --> 00:06:35.197
- Gu Qianfu?
- Gu Qianfu?

00:06:37.197 --> 00:06:39.516
Grand Tutor Zhou and the Jing'an Bureau
are up to no good.

00:06:40.077 --> 00:06:41.237
Isn't Jing'an Bureau

00:06:41.797 --> 00:06:43.077
here to protect us?

00:06:43.557 --> 00:06:44.516
Jiaoqian.

00:06:45.237 --> 00:06:46.997
In this world, aside from ourselves,

00:06:47.437 --> 00:06:48.877
no one can truly protect us.

00:06:49.516 --> 00:06:50.117
Listen.

00:06:50.797 --> 00:06:51.956
She is part of Xue family.

00:06:52.677 --> 00:06:53.836
If she alone makes a mistake,

00:06:54.197 --> 00:06:55.156
our entire Xue family,

00:06:55.437 --> 00:06:56.317
even Dongyang,

00:06:56.797 --> 00:06:57.716
will be implicated.

00:07:00.997 --> 00:07:01.437
Jiaoqian.

00:07:02.077 --> 00:07:02.916
Apologize to her.

00:07:04.557 --> 00:07:05.156
Me?

00:07:05.677 --> 00:07:06.716
Apologize to her?

00:07:07.637 --> 00:07:09.237
Although I did it wrong,

00:07:09.716 --> 00:07:10.877
does she do nothing wrong?

00:07:11.476 --> 00:07:12.916
She's always acting

00:07:13.476 --> 00:07:14.197
this and that.

00:07:15.036 --> 00:07:16.877
What do you mean?

00:07:16.877 --> 00:07:17.877
Acting so virtuous...

00:07:18.877 --> 00:07:20.197
And smart.

00:07:21.437 --> 00:07:23.637
I heard you brought honor

00:07:24.036 --> 00:07:25.836
to Xue family at the Flower Banquet.

00:07:26.276 --> 00:07:27.956
Remarkable!

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:29.036
I knew

00:07:29.237 --> 00:07:30.677
you are beautiful, kind,

00:07:30.836 --> 00:07:31.836
and smart.

00:07:33.237 --> 00:07:34.197
(She is beautiful,)

00:07:34.317 --> 00:07:35.317
(but kind?)

00:07:36.197 --> 00:07:37.237
More than that!

00:07:37.557 --> 00:07:38.997
She treats our entire family

00:07:39.197 --> 00:07:41.197
so well.

00:07:41.557 --> 00:07:43.437
As gentle as our own mother.

00:07:45.437 --> 00:07:47.757
(This family is truly bizarre.)

00:07:49.317 --> 00:07:49.877
Oh, no!

00:07:49.997 --> 00:07:51.237
Mr. Dongyang is missing!

00:07:51.437 --> 00:07:52.077
What?

00:07:54.197 --> 00:07:54.757
Jiaoqian!

00:07:55.877 --> 00:07:56.437
Jiaoqian!

00:08:00.156 --> 00:08:01.716
(It must be Gu Qianfu's doing again.)

00:08:02.317 --> 00:08:03.237
(It's definitely her.)

00:08:05.396 --> 00:08:06.557
(Dragging such a heavy man,)

00:08:06.956 --> 00:08:07.757
(he can't go far.)

00:08:10.916 --> 00:08:11.317
Stop!

00:08:13.256 --> 00:08:13.956
Where's Dongyang?

00:08:14.956 --> 00:08:16.036
You?

00:08:24.757 --> 00:08:25.596
Never expected

00:08:26.356 --> 00:08:28.237
you to know martial arts.

00:08:29.036 --> 00:08:29.757
But,

00:08:30.476 --> 00:08:31.476
treating me this way

00:08:32.077 --> 00:08:33.197
is terribly rude.

00:08:33.836 --> 00:08:35.517
We have treated you with sincerity.

00:08:36.797 --> 00:08:38.397
Have you no conscience?

00:08:38.797 --> 00:08:40.557
I always act with integrity

00:08:40.557 --> 00:08:41.356
and admit what I do.

00:08:41.836 --> 00:08:43.277
Dongyang's missing isn't my doing.

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:44.677
Since you married my father,

00:08:45.197 --> 00:08:46.317
you've been scheming.

00:08:47.077 --> 00:08:48.317
Dongyang has a child's mind,

00:08:48.557 --> 00:08:49.596
yet you dared harm him?

00:08:50.116 --> 00:08:51.077
Have you no family?

00:08:56.116 --> 00:08:56.876
My family

00:08:58.397 --> 00:08:58.956
is all dead.

00:09:00.996 --> 00:09:01.636
No wonder!

00:09:02.476 --> 00:09:03.596
You're so vicious.

00:09:04.476 --> 00:09:05.197
I bet they

00:09:05.596 --> 00:09:06.797
got killed because of you.

00:09:11.197 --> 00:09:11.917
Die!

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.888
(Jing'an Bureau)

00:09:26.504 --> 00:09:27.037
Hurry!

00:09:28.077 --> 00:09:29.157
Interrogate him.

00:09:32.277 --> 00:09:32.996
What a shame.

00:09:33.476 --> 00:09:34.317
We're off work.

00:09:38.397 --> 00:09:39.517
But it's not over!

00:09:39.917 --> 00:09:40.797
There's still time.

00:09:41.236 --> 00:09:42.077
Make an exception.

00:09:42.277 --> 00:09:43.197
Mr. Gu,

00:09:43.557 --> 00:09:45.836
per Jing'an Bureau
Administrative Regulations,

00:09:46.157 --> 00:09:47.836
Chapter 3, Article 5,

00:09:48.236 --> 00:09:49.876
please come tomorrow at Chen hour.

00:09:50.517 --> 00:09:51.236
Then,

00:09:51.397 --> 00:09:56.236
we'll serve you.

00:10:04.677 --> 00:10:05.716
How can you

00:10:05.836 --> 00:10:07.077
be so negligent?

00:10:07.677 --> 00:10:08.996
This is dereliction of duty!

00:10:09.437 --> 00:10:10.277
Are you insane?

00:10:21.317 --> 00:10:21.996
Die!

00:10:34.636 --> 00:10:35.996
I am indeed vicious,

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.797
but my family's innocent.

00:10:38.376 --> 00:10:39.356
Xue Hexu.

00:10:39.836 --> 00:10:41.317
Utter one more slander,

00:10:42.636 --> 00:10:43.636
you must die.

00:10:44.956 --> 00:10:45.636
Where's Dongyang?

00:10:45.797 --> 00:10:46.636
I'll look for him.

00:10:47.716 --> 00:10:48.517
Cut the crap.

00:10:49.557 --> 00:10:50.996
You know well why Xue Dongyang

00:10:50.996 --> 00:10:51.956
got kidnapped.

00:10:52.476 --> 00:10:53.836
Whether he can return safely

00:10:54.317 --> 00:10:55.236
depends on

00:10:55.677 --> 00:10:57.476
if you can verify

00:10:58.236 --> 00:10:59.636
he should live.

00:11:01.677 --> 00:11:02.557
The birthmark?

00:11:02.956 --> 00:11:04.716
(Gu Qianfu strips people's clothes.)

00:11:05.557 --> 00:11:06.956
Come. I'll show you something.

00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:10.437
Jiaoqian.

00:11:10.797 --> 00:11:12.197
Please be fine.

00:11:13.077 --> 00:11:13.557
Jiaoqian.

00:11:14.517 --> 00:11:15.037
Wake up!

00:11:15.037 --> 00:11:15.876
Why bring me back?

00:11:20.397 --> 00:11:21.116
Ms. Wang,

00:11:21.876 --> 00:11:22.876
it must be you!

00:11:23.157 --> 00:11:24.596
I knew you were up to no good.

00:11:25.077 --> 00:11:26.116
Give Dongyang back to me.

00:11:26.312 --> 00:11:26.797
Jiaoqian.

00:11:26.876 --> 00:11:27.517
- Jiaoqian.
- Jiaoqian.

00:11:28.557 --> 00:11:29.197
Calm down.

00:11:33.517 --> 00:11:34.157
Now,

00:11:34.317 --> 00:11:35.397
we can't find Dongyang.

00:11:35.917 --> 00:11:37.037
We'll have to use

00:11:37.277 --> 00:11:38.596
our secret technique.

00:11:39.956 --> 00:11:40.356
Hexu,

00:11:40.797 --> 00:11:41.996
do you mean

00:11:42.236 --> 00:11:42.797
that?

00:11:44.756 --> 00:11:45.356
That?

00:11:45.996 --> 00:11:47.756
Are you sure?

00:11:49.197 --> 00:11:49.836
What's that?

00:11:54.157 --> 00:11:54.636
What?

00:11:55.517 --> 00:11:55.956
Listen.

00:11:56.557 --> 00:11:58.517
Everyone in Xue family
carries a birthmark.

00:11:59.236 --> 00:12:00.077
Seems meaningless,

00:12:00.317 --> 00:12:02.236
yet it can make the divination.

00:12:09.557 --> 00:12:10.956
(Everyone in Xue family)

00:12:11.636 --> 00:12:13.356
(has identical birthmarks.)

00:12:16.277 --> 00:12:17.596
I see.

00:12:18.476 --> 00:12:20.277
What a surprise.

00:12:24.236 --> 00:12:25.636
Is Dongyang safe?

00:12:26.317 --> 00:12:29.157
According to the birthmark's divination,

00:12:29.956 --> 00:12:31.716
he is likely trapped somewhere.

00:12:32.836 --> 00:12:34.116
West?

00:12:35.116 --> 00:12:36.116
East?

00:12:36.557 --> 00:12:37.596
North?

00:12:38.636 --> 00:12:39.317
Or...

00:12:39.596 --> 00:12:41.956
(Gu Qianfu must've discovered
Dongyang's birthmark,)

00:12:42.356 --> 00:12:43.756
(hence, he kidnapped him.)

00:12:46.397 --> 00:12:48.037
Stepmother, give me a word.

00:12:50.636 --> 00:12:51.116
Wrong.

00:12:52.677 --> 00:12:55.037
Well, this word

00:12:55.557 --> 00:12:56.517
means money and time.

00:12:57.236 --> 00:12:58.116
Does it mean

00:12:58.397 --> 00:12:59.956
the kidnappers will execute Dongyang

00:13:00.116 --> 00:13:01.157
if they get no money?

00:13:01.157 --> 00:13:01.716
Wait!

00:13:01.956 --> 00:13:02.756
Don't say nonsense.

00:13:02.876 --> 00:13:03.716
It's 'wrong'.

00:13:04.277 --> 00:13:05.476
It actually means

00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:08.716
Dongyang is temporarily safe.

00:13:08.956 --> 00:13:10.236
The kidnappers won't harm him,

00:13:10.397 --> 00:13:11.317
avoiding alerting us.

00:13:11.996 --> 00:13:13.557
Instead of wasting time here,

00:13:13.836 --> 00:13:14.836
we should look for him.

00:13:33.037 --> 00:13:33.716
Feng Zuoren.

00:13:35.356 --> 00:13:35.996
What's wrong?

00:13:36.917 --> 00:13:37.756
You're wrong.

00:13:38.476 --> 00:13:40.037
He isn't the former Crown Prince.

00:13:40.596 --> 00:13:41.197
What?

00:13:42.677 --> 00:13:44.636
Everyone in Xue family has a birthmark.

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:46.797
Xue Dongyang is just an ordinary person.

00:13:49.277 --> 00:13:50.517
Nonsense!

00:13:52.356 --> 00:13:53.356
Think I'll believe that?

00:13:54.157 --> 00:13:55.437
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:13:55.876 --> 00:13:56.677
It must be real.

00:14:00.077 --> 00:14:02.716
You learned I hold
the former Crown Prince,

00:14:03.112 --> 00:14:04.636
so you pulled this trick.

00:14:05.277 --> 00:14:06.517
I can prove it to you.

00:14:06.797 --> 00:14:07.716
How?

00:14:16.636 --> 00:14:17.956
(You've been terrified.)

00:14:18.437 --> 00:14:19.277
(I've hired)

00:14:19.277 --> 00:14:20.797
(an expert bath scrubber)

00:14:21.236 --> 00:14:22.716
(to scrub)

00:14:22.716 --> 00:14:23.277
(your backs.)

00:14:23.557 --> 00:14:24.277
(Just relax.)

00:14:31.797 --> 00:14:35.077
Can't wait to experience his skills.

00:14:42.677 --> 00:14:44.077
I'll begin then.

00:14:45.956 --> 00:14:48.037
Let me start with you, Mr. Xue Hexu.

00:14:53.996 --> 00:14:54.876
Are you serious?

00:15:14.077 --> 00:15:14.557
That hurts.

00:15:15.077 --> 00:15:15.956
That's my birthmark,

00:15:16.236 --> 00:15:16.876
not dirt.

00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:18.317
Gentler.

00:15:20.557 --> 00:15:21.437
My apologies.

00:15:25.557 --> 00:15:26.152
Stop, stop.

00:15:26.596 --> 00:15:27.304
Stop, stop!

00:15:36.116 --> 00:15:37.116
Comfortable.

00:15:45.517 --> 00:15:47.197
Harder! Harder!

00:15:50.797 --> 00:15:51.317
Right.

00:15:51.476 --> 00:15:52.517
Don't stop!

00:15:53.356 --> 00:15:54.077
Scrub thoroughly.

00:15:54.356 --> 00:15:54.996
Harder.

00:15:55.277 --> 00:15:55.797
Scrub harder.

00:16:01.677 --> 00:16:02.317
Harder.

00:16:05.836 --> 00:16:06.236
Come on.

00:16:06.236 --> 00:16:07.236
(Marks won't come off.)

00:16:07.797 --> 00:16:09.236
(Could they truly be birthmarks?)

00:16:10.277 --> 00:16:11.716
(What kind of family is this?)

00:16:14.157 --> 00:16:15.197
Now you understand.

00:16:15.476 --> 00:16:17.236
Xue Dongyang might not be our target.

00:16:18.197 --> 00:16:20.557
Arrest the wrong man
and mislead superiors.

00:16:21.197 --> 00:16:22.636
By Jing'an Bureau's regulations,

00:16:22.956 --> 00:16:24.836
this is more than negligence.

00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:26.116
At minimum,

00:16:26.557 --> 00:16:27.677
you shall be exiled.

00:16:30.157 --> 00:16:32.037
But it is the Crown Prince's birthmark.

00:16:33.356 --> 00:16:34.116
What went wrong?

00:16:35.596 --> 00:16:37.996
Everyone in Xue family
has this birthmark.

00:16:38.956 --> 00:16:39.917
This proves even more

00:16:40.797 --> 00:16:43.836
they're harboring
the former Crown Prince,

00:16:44.517 --> 00:16:46.517
so they're protecting him in every way.

00:16:47.917 --> 00:16:50.037
But I've arrested
the fat man into Jing'an Bureau.

00:16:52.636 --> 00:16:53.476
Maybe

00:16:54.677 --> 00:16:55.517
I should

00:16:56.317 --> 00:16:57.032
silence him.

00:16:57.397 --> 00:16:58.077
Fool!

00:17:00.476 --> 00:17:02.677
The Xue family will fight to the death.

00:17:03.157 --> 00:17:05.077
The Emperor demands discretion.

00:17:06.757 --> 00:17:07.596
Don't insult me!

00:17:09.077 --> 00:17:09.636
What now?

00:17:11.557 --> 00:17:13.116
We can't alert them now.

00:17:13.636 --> 00:17:14.517
Only one solution.

00:17:15.916 --> 00:17:16.557
Break the jail.

00:17:17.676 --> 00:17:18.156
What?

00:17:19.277 --> 00:17:20.037
Have you gone mad?

00:17:20.237 --> 00:17:21.277
We can't break

00:17:21.477 --> 00:17:22.037
the jail.

00:17:22.156 --> 00:17:23.317
Are you insane?

00:17:23.477 --> 00:17:24.596
If you didn't arrest him,

00:17:25.037 --> 00:17:25.997
we needn't do so.

00:17:27.436 --> 00:17:27.997
Feng Zuoren.

00:17:28.477 --> 00:17:29.396
I'm warning you.

00:17:29.797 --> 00:17:30.277
I...

00:17:30.277 --> 00:17:31.037
Exchange antidotes

00:17:31.636 --> 00:17:32.477
and cooperate.

00:17:34.557 --> 00:17:34.957
Fine.

00:17:54.312 --> 00:17:56.392
(Jing'an Bureau)

00:18:16.156 --> 00:18:16.797
What is it?

00:18:23.477 --> 00:18:24.396
Now.

00:18:33.477 --> 00:18:34.916
I'll wait by the gate.

00:18:46.876 --> 00:18:47.676
Come on.

00:18:50.436 --> 00:18:51.557
- Come on.
- Come on.

00:18:57.499 --> 00:18:59.848
(Green Dragon)

00:19:07.676 --> 00:19:08.196
I won.

00:19:08.596 --> 00:19:09.557
13 terminal tiles?

00:19:10.356 --> 00:19:11.757
How did you complete this?

00:19:14.757 --> 00:19:15.676
I've lost all my money.

00:19:18.836 --> 00:19:20.396
Isn't he supposed to be an idiot?

00:19:22.557 --> 00:19:23.517
You're faking it.

00:19:24.168 --> 00:19:24.676
I...

00:19:24.676 --> 00:19:25.396
How dare you!

00:19:55.797 --> 00:19:56.277
Stepmother.

00:20:00.517 --> 00:20:01.116
Go home.

00:20:01.676 --> 00:20:02.477
No.

00:20:03.037 --> 00:20:04.237
I've won so much money.

00:20:04.237 --> 00:20:05.517
I'll take all their money.

00:20:07.557 --> 00:20:08.717
Why do you need money?

00:20:10.636 --> 00:20:11.477
Hexu works hard

00:20:12.037 --> 00:20:12.916
and Jiaoqian always

00:20:13.277 --> 00:20:14.237
worries about me.

00:20:15.156 --> 00:20:16.317
I know I'm useless.

00:20:16.916 --> 00:20:18.636
Earning more money won't harm.

00:20:21.836 --> 00:20:23.356
You're perfect as you are.

00:20:23.757 --> 00:20:24.477
Come home with me.

00:20:24.836 --> 00:20:25.836
We all worry about you.

00:20:38.156 --> 00:20:38.557
Well...

00:20:38.636 --> 00:20:39.196
Go with me.

00:20:53.237 --> 00:20:53.957
Hurry!

00:20:55.436 --> 00:20:56.557
How can we hurry?

00:20:58.517 --> 00:20:59.916
Don't touch them.

00:21:01.596 --> 00:21:02.596
Dongyang, take it slow.

00:21:04.477 --> 00:21:04.916
Come on.

00:21:40.836 --> 00:21:41.277
Come on.

00:21:59.528 --> 00:22:00.037
Hurry.

00:22:06.596 --> 00:22:08.396
Your sedatives are not effective at all.

00:22:08.776 --> 00:22:09.237
No.

00:22:09.277 --> 00:22:10.077
Who are you people?

00:22:14.997 --> 00:22:16.396
We've been exposed.

00:22:16.676 --> 00:22:17.277
With him,

00:22:17.396 --> 00:22:18.116
we won't escape.

00:22:18.116 --> 00:22:18.596
No way.

00:22:18.757 --> 00:22:19.208
Bye then.

00:22:19.517 --> 00:22:20.477
If you don't take him,

00:22:20.596 --> 00:22:21.757
I'll report you.

00:22:23.836 --> 00:22:24.676
Dongyang, let's go.

00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:25.876
No, Stepmother.

00:22:25.928 --> 00:22:26.472
Go!

00:22:31.277 --> 00:22:32.797
How dare you

00:22:32.797 --> 00:22:33.768
to break the jail!

00:22:52.717 --> 00:22:53.277
Hexu.

00:22:53.436 --> 00:22:54.997
You can't think of Stepmother

00:22:54.997 --> 00:22:56.436
as evil without any evidence.

00:22:57.037 --> 00:22:58.797
Though she married into the family,

00:22:59.156 --> 00:23:00.037
so did I.

00:23:00.636 --> 00:23:01.876
We are all family.

00:23:02.717 --> 00:23:03.624
Aren't you worried

00:23:03.624 --> 00:23:05.277
this is her scheme to devour our assets?

00:23:06.836 --> 00:23:08.156
So you don't trust her.

00:23:09.077 --> 00:23:10.557
I thought you and Dongyang

00:23:10.676 --> 00:23:11.916
were both under her spell.

00:23:12.296 --> 00:23:14.504
At the banquet, I knew
there's something between you.

00:23:15.237 --> 00:23:16.196
She's our elder.

00:23:16.876 --> 00:23:17.636
I thought

00:23:18.156 --> 00:23:19.477
you two...

00:23:19.676 --> 00:23:21.957
Jiaoqian, what are you talking about?

00:23:22.396 --> 00:23:24.676
It's clearly a forbidden love

00:23:24.876 --> 00:23:27.836
that grows over time.

00:23:31.477 --> 00:23:32.876
What did you say?

00:23:54.636 --> 00:23:55.876
Dongyang!

00:23:56.077 --> 00:23:56.997
Jiaoqian!

00:23:56.997 --> 00:23:57.636
Oh my!

00:23:58.596 --> 00:23:59.997
Where have you been?

00:23:59.997 --> 00:24:00.717
I was so worried.

00:24:00.717 --> 00:24:02.356
I went out alone yesterday

00:24:02.517 --> 00:24:04.396
and accidentally got lost.

00:24:04.797 --> 00:24:05.396
Lost?

00:24:06.116 --> 00:24:07.116
How come?

00:24:07.797 --> 00:24:09.077
The streets were too crowded,

00:24:09.957 --> 00:24:10.876
so I got lost.

00:24:12.916 --> 00:24:13.517
Dongyang.

00:24:14.797 --> 00:24:15.836
When we return home,

00:24:15.997 --> 00:24:17.596
if anyone asks where you went,

00:24:17.916 --> 00:24:18.920
just say

00:24:19.037 --> 00:24:20.717
you went out and got lost

00:24:21.156 --> 00:24:22.757
and I found you, okay?

00:24:24.997 --> 00:24:26.156
But Stepmother,

00:24:26.636 --> 00:24:28.237
you were so brave last night.

00:24:28.596 --> 00:24:29.957
I want everyone to know it.

00:24:30.277 --> 00:24:31.676
Why can't we tell them?

00:24:32.196 --> 00:24:34.237
I don't want them to worry.

00:24:34.557 --> 00:24:36.836
Let's keep this as our secret.

00:24:39.317 --> 00:24:39.916
Secret.

00:24:41.077 --> 00:24:41.636
Good boy.

00:24:42.152 --> 00:24:42.596
Go.

00:24:46.797 --> 00:24:47.916
Did you save Dongyang?

00:24:48.196 --> 00:24:49.277
You're such a hero!

00:24:52.797 --> 00:24:54.356
Stepmother, you're hurt!

00:24:54.717 --> 00:24:55.836
Just a little fall.

00:24:56.557 --> 00:24:57.797
I need to take some rest.

00:25:11.037 --> 00:25:12.277
You cunning Ms. Wang!

00:25:12.517 --> 00:25:14.317
Scheming to infiltrate the Xue family.

00:25:14.916 --> 00:25:16.876
Your vile plot might've
already succeeded.

00:25:17.517 --> 00:25:18.396
Otherwise,

00:25:19.116 --> 00:25:20.156
why would I

00:25:21.116 --> 00:25:22.077
feel so troubled?

00:25:23.596 --> 00:25:24.116
Enough!

00:25:24.916 --> 00:25:26.717
Stop that now!

00:25:26.997 --> 00:25:28.517
She's an assassin sent by the emperor!

00:25:30.757 --> 00:25:31.277
Young Master.

00:25:31.676 --> 00:25:33.037
She did help us

00:25:33.237 --> 00:25:35.237
when we needed assistance.

00:25:35.517 --> 00:25:36.037
Right?

00:25:43.116 --> 00:25:43.916
Ms. Wang,

00:25:44.557 --> 00:25:45.717
you cloud my judgment.

00:25:46.277 --> 00:25:47.836
If I don't expose your schemes,

00:25:48.237 --> 00:25:49.676
how can I protect the Xue family?

00:25:50.317 --> 00:25:50.797
Wait.

00:25:57.636 --> 00:25:59.368
But she got injured

00:25:59.368 --> 00:26:00.436
for saving Dongyang.

00:26:01.797 --> 00:26:02.517
But I think

00:26:02.636 --> 00:26:03.356
it's improper

00:26:03.916 --> 00:26:05.037
to confront her now.

00:26:12.997 --> 00:26:13.797
She's injured.

00:26:14.156 --> 00:26:14.916
I should help her.

00:26:16.277 --> 00:26:16.757
Exactly.

00:26:26.408 --> 00:26:28.008
(Wound Ointment, Stasis Dispersant)

00:26:36.836 --> 00:26:38.717
(Just go with the flow)

00:26:39.237 --> 00:26:40.477
(and complete the mission.)

00:26:41.636 --> 00:26:43.317
(Yet I saved Dongyang?)

00:26:44.557 --> 00:26:46.037
(That brat is full of tricks,)

00:26:46.277 --> 00:26:47.237
(just wants me dead.)

00:26:48.396 --> 00:26:49.916
(Feng Zuoren, oh you.)

00:26:50.477 --> 00:26:52.436
(When did you become so indecisive?)

00:26:54.557 --> 00:26:55.396
(Before,)

00:26:56.037 --> 00:26:57.396
(you never hesitated to kill.)

00:26:58.596 --> 00:27:00.356
(Has the Xue family poisoned your mind?)

00:27:01.676 --> 00:27:03.797
(Or has that Xue Hexu
clouded your mind?)
