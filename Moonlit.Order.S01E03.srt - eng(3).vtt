=Episode 3=

00:01:40.668 --> 00:01:41.707
This...

00:01:42.108 --> 00:01:42.547
This...

00:01:42.907 --> 00:01:43.907
This...

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.868
This...

00:01:47.144 --> 00:01:47.748
This...

00:01:49.508 --> 00:01:50.148
This soup

00:01:57.148 --> 00:01:58.788
is amazing, Dongyang.

00:02:00.907 --> 00:02:01.627
It's perfect.

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:02.668
Almost sweet.

00:02:02.948 --> 00:02:04.588
Jiaoqian is cooking even better.

00:02:04.588 --> 00:02:05.347
Lucky you.

00:02:05.868 --> 00:02:06.827
(Why hasn't the poison)

00:02:07.688 --> 00:02:08.388
(taken effect?)

00:02:08.587 --> 00:02:10.508
She must have been shocked, too.

00:02:11.388 --> 00:02:13.068
The soup smelled bitter.

00:02:13.307 --> 00:02:15.547
So I added some mung beans,

00:02:15.688 --> 00:02:17.388
licorice root, and honeysuckle.

00:02:17.628 --> 00:02:18.747
Doesn't it taste sweet?

00:02:19.147 --> 00:02:21.027
(He added all those
detoxifying ingredients?)

00:02:21.547 --> 00:02:23.068
(So he saved this brat.)

00:02:24.068 --> 00:02:24.747
Yeah, it does.

00:02:26.307 --> 00:02:27.147
You're so clever.

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:28.628
You can be a chef, too.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.147
Alright.

00:02:29.587 --> 00:02:30.027
Thanks.

00:02:30.348 --> 00:02:30.987
Back to work.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.267
(Xue Dongyang)

00:02:34.792 --> 00:02:36.108
(has to die, too.)

00:02:45.827 --> 00:02:46.348
His Majesty

00:02:46.587 --> 00:02:47.628
wants to see you.

00:02:54.888 --> 00:02:56.968
(Taiji Hall)

00:03:01.608 --> 00:03:02.228
Your Majesty.

00:03:03.508 --> 00:03:04.668
Take the elixir

00:03:04.987 --> 00:03:06.228
(Mr. Immortal, Imperial Astronomer)
for this month

00:03:07.068 --> 00:03:09.188
and you will surely be better.

00:03:25.788 --> 00:03:26.792
Thank you, Mr. Immortal.

00:03:30.707 --> 00:03:31.508
Feng Zuoren.

00:03:32.547 --> 00:03:34.827
You've caused commotions repeatedly.

00:03:35.267 --> 00:03:35.948
This time,

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.508
you even killed my messenger.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.587
Do you confess?

00:03:44.348 --> 00:03:45.309
I confess.

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.029
I beg Your Majesty for more time.

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:49.748
The Xue family

00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:51.508
is deeply suspicious.

00:03:52.228 --> 00:03:52.748
And

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:54.228
the Jing'an Bureau

00:03:54.628 --> 00:03:56.424
is also looking
for the former Crown Prince.

00:03:56.788 --> 00:04:00.109
(Grand Tutor Zhou
abused his position at court)

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.149
(and acted without authorization,)

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:04.829
(showing signs of treachery.)

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:06.788
(I must urge Feng Zuoren on.)

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:10.029
You're my most valued subordinate.

00:04:10.668 --> 00:04:12.829
But you've been slow on this job.

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:16.548
That's why I ordered
the Jing'an Bureau to assist.

00:04:16.988 --> 00:04:18.868
The Xue Guardians will surely

00:04:18.868 --> 00:04:19.988
kill the former Crown Prince

00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:21.709
before they do.

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:24.069
Keep it discreet.

00:04:25.308 --> 00:04:26.629
Don't trouble me further.

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:28.189
You may leave.

00:04:40.908 --> 00:04:41.509
Mr. Immortal.

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.108
Is this person

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:45.868
still trustworthy?

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:48.228
I only know one thing.

00:04:48.668 --> 00:04:50.589
Those who betray Your Majesty's trust

00:04:50.868 --> 00:04:52.348
meet unfortunate ends.

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:01.189
(There are 16 people,
including servants.)

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:03.668
(The family members
are in the east wing.)

00:05:04.348 --> 00:05:05.629
(When darkness falls tonight,)

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.949
(Xue Mansion)

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:07.149
(I'll storm the east wing)

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:08.868
(and complete the mission)

00:05:09.108 --> 00:05:10.189
(before anyone notices.)

00:05:12.348 --> 00:05:13.269
(Prepare to die.)

00:05:14.428 --> 00:05:14.949
Yeah.

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:16.149
Are you that curious?

00:05:33.348 --> 00:05:34.269
This must be

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:36.228
Ms. Wang, who just married
into our family.

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:43.509
You're far too thin.

00:05:43.752 --> 00:05:44.269
Hurry.

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:46.280
Sit and have some food.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.269
Come on.

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:51.348
Sit here.

00:06:10.988 --> 00:06:11.709
Ms. Wang.

00:06:12.468 --> 00:06:13.589
On your wedding day,

00:06:13.868 --> 00:06:15.348
misfortune took place

00:06:15.829 --> 00:06:17.512
and ruined your moment.

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:19.816
Hexu is thoughtful

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:23.269
and invited all the ladies of our clan

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:25.548
to gather here

00:06:25.788 --> 00:06:27.428
and recreate your wedding feast.

00:06:29.788 --> 00:06:31.709
(It's Xue Hexu again!)

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:35.468
Thank you, Madam.

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:46.069
This is Ms. Li of the third branch.

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:51.829
This is your cousin Ms. Zhao.

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:09.189
Thank you

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:11.108
for your affection.

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:14.029
I'm Lord Dingyuan's wet nurse.

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:16.269
My "son" is getting married.

00:07:16.468 --> 00:07:17.829
How could I not come?

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.348
Let me have a good look.

00:07:22.668 --> 00:07:24.509
What a pretty girl.

00:07:24.749 --> 00:07:27.269
Hurry and expand the family line.

00:07:27.709 --> 00:07:29.069
Lord Dingyuan is still young.

00:07:29.269 --> 00:07:30.988
Two sons could never be enough.

00:07:31.149 --> 00:07:33.589
When I nursed your husband,

00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:35.348
he ate vigorously

00:07:35.348 --> 00:07:36.509
with a great appetite.

00:07:36.668 --> 00:07:39.656
He's bound to have
eight or ten children.

00:07:44.709 --> 00:07:46.709
I had already retired to my hometown.

00:07:46.908 --> 00:07:48.228
I never imagined

00:07:48.348 --> 00:07:51.269
I'd live to see
another wedding for our lord.

00:07:53.509 --> 00:07:54.269
Exactly.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.029
Come on.

00:07:58.949 --> 00:08:00.589
(I'll seat you next to my stepmother.)

00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.988
(Kill her.)

00:08:02.348 --> 00:08:04.348
(Then you will receive great rewards.)

00:08:08.589 --> 00:08:10.308
Madam, please eat too.

00:08:14.668 --> 00:08:15.868
What an exquisite dish.

00:08:16.308 --> 00:08:16.908
This is...?

00:08:17.108 --> 00:08:18.468
Shrimp with mixed vegetables.

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:21.868
Our lord has suffered.

00:08:22.069 --> 00:08:23.908
He lost his wife too young.

00:08:24.668 --> 00:08:26.389
I meant the previous one.

00:08:33.068 --> 00:08:35.400
What an exquisite dish.

00:08:35.749 --> 00:08:36.552
This is...?

00:08:37.349 --> 00:08:38.856
Stewed meat with deer antler.

00:08:39.948 --> 00:08:41.428
How unusual.

00:08:44.668 --> 00:08:45.288
Snake!

00:08:50.308 --> 00:08:51.188
Someone help!

00:08:51.469 --> 00:08:52.428
Someone help!

00:08:53.469 --> 00:08:55.389
Be careful. Watch your step.

00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:56.708
There's a snake!

00:09:00.708 --> 00:09:01.908
It's fine, Granny Liu.

00:09:01.928 --> 00:09:02.629
It's fine.

00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:04.588
How terrifying!

00:09:04.588 --> 00:09:05.308
Don't be scared.

00:09:31.308 --> 00:09:32.308
(Xue Hexu.)

00:09:33.068 --> 00:09:34.269
Oh no. This is bad.

00:09:38.749 --> 00:09:39.269
All settled?

00:09:39.656 --> 00:09:40.308
Stepmother.

00:09:40.749 --> 00:09:41.349
Are you okay?

00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:44.136
The snake is gone?

00:09:45.629 --> 00:09:46.389
Are you alright?

00:09:46.869 --> 00:09:47.548
Were you scared?

00:09:49.109 --> 00:09:49.749
I'm fine.

00:09:52.908 --> 00:09:54.389
That snake was quite fast.

00:10:01.788 --> 00:10:02.509
My lord, help.

00:10:02.948 --> 00:10:05.308
My second stepson
sent an assassin to kill me.

00:10:05.869 --> 00:10:07.029
(These two again.)

00:10:07.308 --> 00:10:08.428
(Same moves.)

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:09.948
Calm down, Madam.

00:10:10.428 --> 00:10:11.629
Please get up first.

00:10:12.109 --> 00:10:14.269
I can't calm down, my lord.

00:10:15.068 --> 00:10:15.668
We were hosting

00:10:15.828 --> 00:10:18.068
a banquet for the female clan members.

00:10:18.428 --> 00:10:19.188
However,

00:10:19.588 --> 00:10:21.109
an imposter among the guests

00:10:21.668 --> 00:10:22.668
tried to kill me.

00:10:24.188 --> 00:10:25.828
There is the vicious assassin.

00:10:26.469 --> 00:10:28.229
Some put her to do this.

00:10:29.548 --> 00:10:30.149
She even

00:10:30.668 --> 00:10:32.989
released a snake during the feast.

00:10:33.389 --> 00:10:34.548
Amidst the chaos,

00:10:34.548 --> 00:10:35.828
she drew a blade against me.

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:37.349
Failing the task,

00:10:37.548 --> 00:10:38.948
she pretended to pass out.

00:10:39.828 --> 00:10:41.469
See the slash on my sleeve.

00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:44.588
Now observe her weapon.

00:10:45.389 --> 00:10:46.229
The shape

00:10:46.428 --> 00:10:47.509
is identical!

00:10:49.768 --> 00:10:50.469
My son.

00:10:51.149 --> 00:10:52.068
I know

00:10:52.428 --> 00:10:53.828
you are against me.

00:10:54.428 --> 00:10:55.029
But how

00:10:56.668 --> 00:10:57.989
could you conspire with others

00:10:58.149 --> 00:10:59.349
to take my life?

00:11:04.149 --> 00:11:04.509
She...

00:11:04.948 --> 00:11:05.509
She woke up.

00:11:07.029 --> 00:11:07.869
You villain!

00:11:08.149 --> 00:11:09.788
Name your conspirators now.

00:11:10.109 --> 00:11:11.588
Maybe His Honor

00:11:11.588 --> 00:11:12.509
will spare you.

00:11:16.428 --> 00:11:17.989
There must be a misunderstanding.

00:11:21.109 --> 00:11:21.588
Miss.

00:11:22.948 --> 00:11:24.296
You seem kind-hearted.

00:11:25.029 --> 00:11:26.509
You can't be an assassin.

00:11:28.149 --> 00:11:28.948
Are you a guest?

00:11:31.469 --> 00:11:31.908
Yeah.

00:11:32.469 --> 00:11:34.440
I came for the feast.

00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:45.256
You brought weapons to a feast?

00:11:46.229 --> 00:11:47.269
And so many?

00:11:51.828 --> 00:11:53.948
I'm actually a butcher.

00:11:54.509 --> 00:11:56.469
These are family heirlooms.

00:11:56.869 --> 00:11:57.548
They are

00:11:58.109 --> 00:11:59.308
wedding gifts for you.

00:12:00.229 --> 00:12:00.869
That's right.

00:12:01.588 --> 00:12:02.229
Stepmother.

00:12:02.308 --> 00:12:03.788
She's family. You got her wrong.

00:12:04.548 --> 00:12:05.788
So dramatic.

00:12:09.749 --> 00:12:10.349
Madam.

00:12:10.788 --> 00:12:12.788
Which branch does she belong to?

00:12:14.029 --> 00:12:14.668
Yeah.

00:12:15.308 --> 00:12:16.708
I meant to ask earlier.

00:12:17.109 --> 00:12:18.308
Which family are you from?

00:12:28.469 --> 00:12:28.989
My lord.

00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:30.989
I've never seen her before.

00:12:40.308 --> 00:12:41.320
In that case,

00:12:41.908 --> 00:12:43.428
let me tell you the truth.

00:12:44.229 --> 00:12:44.708
She didn't

00:12:45.708 --> 00:12:46.828
come for the feast.

00:12:48.869 --> 00:12:49.389
She came

00:12:50.668 --> 00:12:51.788
to steal the newlywed.

00:12:59.389 --> 00:12:59.948
The newlywed?

00:13:01.068 --> 00:13:01.668
Me?

00:13:02.109 --> 00:13:02.629
No.

00:13:04.229 --> 00:13:05.188
The newlywed.

00:13:06.229 --> 00:13:06.989
Xue Fugui.

00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:11.229
My father.

00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:12.109
(This)

00:13:12.509 --> 00:13:14.109
(is too far-fetched.)

00:13:14.469 --> 00:13:15.389
(How else can we)

00:13:15.548 --> 00:13:16.749
(divert their attention?)

00:13:21.109 --> 00:13:22.312
Is this true?

00:13:25.229 --> 00:13:25.668
Yes.

00:13:26.109 --> 00:13:27.509
I've admired our lord for years,

00:13:27.828 --> 00:13:29.389
seeking to become his wife.

00:13:29.588 --> 00:13:31.389
But you snatched him first.

00:13:31.948 --> 00:13:33.428
So I came to steal him.

00:13:37.548 --> 00:13:38.109
So,

00:13:38.989 --> 00:13:39.948
Xue Hexu let you in

00:13:40.269 --> 00:13:41.256
on purpose?

00:13:41.256 --> 00:13:42.389
What do you mean?

00:13:42.828 --> 00:13:44.109
This young lady

00:13:44.349 --> 00:13:45.428
seems deeply devoted.

00:13:45.548 --> 00:13:46.588
So I helped her.

00:13:46.828 --> 00:13:48.308
My father can have another wife.

00:13:48.749 --> 00:13:49.869
And me another stepmother.

00:13:50.349 --> 00:13:50.869
You!

00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:53.828
Ms. Wang has barely

00:13:54.229 --> 00:13:55.509
married your father,

00:13:56.788 --> 00:13:59.869
and you're already
finding him a concubine?

00:14:00.989 --> 00:14:02.629
He still lies unconscious.

00:14:03.428 --> 00:14:04.188
Absurd.

00:14:08.428 --> 00:14:10.109
In that case...

00:14:13.029 --> 00:14:14.588
It's just a misunderstanding.

00:14:15.109 --> 00:14:16.029
We've troubled you.

00:14:16.269 --> 00:14:18.588
I'll take my leave now.

00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:21.548
(They bothered me with)

00:14:21.749 --> 00:14:22.788
(family affairs again.)

00:14:25.749 --> 00:14:26.269
My lord.

00:14:47.908 --> 00:14:49.149
Let me tell you, son.

00:14:49.349 --> 00:14:50.908
I won't harm anyone in the family.

00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:52.788
Stop opposing me at every turn.

00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:54.229
I'd sooner trust

00:14:54.668 --> 00:14:56.200
that assassin was here for my father

00:14:56.269 --> 00:14:57.229
than believe you.

00:14:58.068 --> 00:14:58.989
What do you want?

00:14:59.389 --> 00:15:01.269
The former Crown Prince Jia Xun.

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:03.389
Cooperate with me,

00:15:03.948 --> 00:15:05.389
and your family will be safe.

00:15:05.948 --> 00:15:07.349
The former Crown Prince?

00:15:08.349 --> 00:15:09.029
Listen.

00:15:09.469 --> 00:15:11.308
The former Crown Prince is not here.

00:15:13.668 --> 00:15:14.749
Still lying?

00:15:15.908 --> 00:15:16.708
Let's see

00:15:17.989 --> 00:15:19.509
whether your wit

00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:21.788
outpaces my blade.

00:15:43.308 --> 00:15:44.308
Keep her under watch.

00:15:44.869 --> 00:15:45.668
Keep me

00:15:45.908 --> 00:15:46.749
updated.

00:15:47.349 --> 00:15:47.869
Understood.

00:15:47.869 --> 00:15:48.188
Go.

00:15:48.269 --> 00:15:48.629
Let's go.

00:15:54.149 --> 00:15:55.588
(I must keep an eye on her,)

00:15:56.188 --> 00:15:58.188
(just in case she harms my family.)

00:16:09.308 --> 00:16:09.788
Wait.

00:16:10.588 --> 00:16:12.509
W-Why hasn't our lady gone to bed?

00:16:16.908 --> 00:16:17.668
Stay on watch.

00:16:17.788 --> 00:16:18.828
I'll take a nap.

00:16:18.948 --> 00:16:19.989
I'll doze off.

00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:21.672
Alright. Sleep.

00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:49.068
Oh no.

00:16:50.668 --> 00:16:51.989
Grandmother.

00:16:52.828 --> 00:16:53.416
Grandmother.

00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:55.548
Dongyang. Jiaoqian.

00:16:55.828 --> 00:16:58.509
Stop shouting. How improper.

00:17:03.349 --> 00:17:04.148
Nuannuan's missing.

00:17:08.828 --> 00:17:09.588
What happened?

00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:27.388
(Why is Gu Qianfu also
following Xue Nuannuan?)

00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:30.828
This one's pretty.

00:17:32.909 --> 00:17:33.749
Smells wonderful.

00:17:33.949 --> 00:17:34.548
I'll take this.

00:17:36.189 --> 00:17:36.828
Thank you.

00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:37.429
Here.

00:17:45.148 --> 00:17:47.029
(Could Xue Nuannuan hold clues?)

00:17:55.509 --> 00:17:57.148
Help. Let go.

00:17:57.709 --> 00:17:58.348
Help.

00:17:58.788 --> 00:17:59.509
Gu Qianfu!

00:17:59.989 --> 00:18:00.989
How despicable.

00:18:11.229 --> 00:18:12.189
Why do you keep

00:18:12.469 --> 00:18:13.269
ruining my plans?

00:18:14.108 --> 00:18:15.868
Stripping a woman in broad daylight?

00:18:16.108 --> 00:18:17.229
A scoundrel like you

00:18:17.308 --> 00:18:18.469
deserves to die!

00:18:21.548 --> 00:18:22.029
So annoying.

00:18:29.588 --> 00:18:30.429
(Darn it.)

00:18:31.029 --> 00:18:32.628
(My inner energy is out of control.)

00:18:35.989 --> 00:18:36.469
Nuannuan.

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:37.628
Are you okay?

00:18:41.628 --> 00:18:42.709
Vile woman, let her go!

00:18:46.628 --> 00:18:48.189
Hexu, what are you doing?

00:19:14.189 --> 00:19:15.709
(Thank goodness, he's useless.)

00:19:16.229 --> 00:19:17.949
(I know good deed goes unrewarded.)

00:19:20.348 --> 00:19:21.308
Nuannuan, you alright?

00:19:22.909 --> 00:19:23.752
Hexu.

00:19:23.949 --> 00:19:26.029
She just saved me from a thug.

00:19:26.989 --> 00:19:28.200
You've misunderstood her.

00:19:55.148 --> 00:19:55.749
A kite.

00:20:00.628 --> 00:20:02.189
Pastries. I'm sorry.

00:20:20.949 --> 00:20:22.189
What poison did you put?

00:20:23.628 --> 00:20:24.509
Bone-Melting Powder?

00:20:25.749 --> 00:20:26.888
Cobra Pill?

00:20:27.868 --> 00:20:28.872
Or Knockout Drops?

00:20:32.956 --> 00:20:33.557
None of those.

00:20:38.676 --> 00:20:39.597
Fine, forget it.

00:20:40.676 --> 00:20:41.716
Why don't you believe

00:20:41.716 --> 00:20:42.996
that I won't hurt your family?

00:20:53.916 --> 00:20:55.048
People suspect that

00:20:55.597 --> 00:20:57.557
we're hiding the former Crown Prince.

00:20:58.557 --> 00:20:59.996
I have to stay vigilant.

00:21:03.476 --> 00:21:04.276
My brother Dongyang

00:21:07.637 --> 00:21:08.557
used to be clever.

00:21:09.357 --> 00:21:10.196
When he was ten,

00:21:10.516 --> 00:21:11.996
someone poisoned our food.

00:21:12.637 --> 00:21:13.676
He sniffed something

00:21:13.916 --> 00:21:14.956
and took the first bite.

00:21:15.637 --> 00:21:16.837
That's how we survived.

00:21:18.516 --> 00:21:19.276
But after that,

00:21:20.276 --> 00:21:21.557
he suffered a raging fever

00:21:21.877 --> 00:21:22.837
for three days

00:21:23.557 --> 00:21:24.716
and ended up like this.

00:21:35.716 --> 00:21:36.424
My father

00:21:37.077 --> 00:21:38.956
used to be a fourth-rank clerk.

00:21:39.676 --> 00:21:41.196
He won several battles and became

00:21:41.676 --> 00:21:42.716
Lord Dingyuan.

00:21:43.516 --> 00:21:45.037
How could he possibly

00:21:45.597 --> 00:21:46.716
save a prince from bandits

00:21:46.996 --> 00:21:47.877
as the rumors claim?

00:21:53.837 --> 00:21:54.676
Even so,

00:21:56.317 --> 00:21:57.597
public opinion is terrifying.

00:21:58.877 --> 00:22:00.077
Even if I fight

00:22:00.797 --> 00:22:01.956
one against a hundred,

00:22:03.117 --> 00:22:05.397
I'll protect my family.

00:22:13.916 --> 00:22:15.756
Since you're being sincere,

00:22:16.877 --> 00:22:18.597
I'll tell you the truth.

00:22:19.317 --> 00:22:20.276
On my wedding day,

00:22:20.916 --> 00:22:22.397
I did plan to kill your family.

00:22:23.157 --> 00:22:24.236
It would've been easy.

00:22:25.077 --> 00:22:26.317
But I am told

00:22:26.476 --> 00:22:27.676
to stay discreet.

00:22:28.516 --> 00:22:29.676
Everyone is nice

00:22:30.276 --> 00:22:31.357
except for you.

00:22:32.516 --> 00:22:34.516
As long as you work with me,

00:22:35.516 --> 00:22:37.436
we'll be one big...

00:22:43.077 --> 00:22:43.756
Happy family.

00:22:45.956 --> 00:22:47.357
(Lies after lies.)

00:22:48.756 --> 00:22:50.157
(Vicious liar.)

00:22:52.476 --> 00:22:53.436
Stepmother.

00:22:57.996 --> 00:22:58.516
Stepmother.

00:22:59.077 --> 00:22:59.837
Come with me.

00:23:00.037 --> 00:23:00.557
Hurry.

00:24:02.716 --> 00:24:03.496
Young master.

00:24:04.996 --> 00:24:06.117
Do you want these?

00:24:08.357 --> 00:24:10.557
Then let's play a game, okay?

00:24:11.276 --> 00:24:11.837
Okay.

00:24:12.616 --> 00:24:13.797
Rules are simple.

00:24:14.637 --> 00:24:16.077
We roll the dice. High roll wins.

00:24:16.637 --> 00:24:17.476
The winner

00:24:17.956 --> 00:24:18.916
gets to pick

00:24:19.117 --> 00:24:20.476
any item here.

00:24:21.476 --> 00:24:22.157
The loser removes

00:24:23.357 --> 00:24:24.637
an article of clothing.

00:24:28.424 --> 00:24:28.996
Alright.

00:24:36.916 --> 00:24:38.037
I'm going home for dinner.

00:24:38.157 --> 00:24:39.196
Let's play next time.

00:24:39.276 --> 00:24:39.637
Bye.

00:24:39.797 --> 00:24:40.360
Young master.

00:24:43.037 --> 00:24:44.597
How about some new rules?

00:24:45.756 --> 00:24:46.597
This time,

00:24:47.304 --> 00:24:49.557
the winner removes clothing.

00:24:50.557 --> 00:24:51.436
The loser

00:24:52.557 --> 00:24:54.877
takes all these prizes.

00:24:56.996 --> 00:24:57.637
Sure.

00:25:18.877 --> 00:25:19.877
I'm done playing.

00:25:21.996 --> 00:25:22.877
What are you doing?

00:25:24.276 --> 00:25:25.597
What are you doing?

00:25:28.877 --> 00:25:29.436
Come here.

00:25:30.916 --> 00:25:31.357
Come here.

00:25:37.716 --> 00:25:38.837
Come here.

00:25:39.877 --> 00:25:41.196
- What are you doing?
- Get in.

00:25:43.397 --> 00:25:44.516
What are you doing?

00:25:44.837 --> 00:25:46.276
Let go.

00:25:47.877 --> 00:25:49.236
Stepmother, take a look.

00:25:49.397 --> 00:25:50.184
I got you

00:25:50.184 --> 00:25:51.877
these fabrics this morning.

00:25:52.317 --> 00:25:53.676
You don't have many clothes.

00:25:53.916 --> 00:25:55.516
And Hexu ruined one of your outfits.

00:25:56.916 --> 00:25:58.877
You went out so early just for this?

00:26:00.077 --> 00:26:01.557
Exactly.

00:26:02.117 --> 00:26:04.716
Even I am jealous.

00:26:05.516 --> 00:26:06.357
Stepmother, choose.

00:26:06.756 --> 00:26:07.236
Look.

00:26:07.837 --> 00:26:08.317
This one,

00:26:08.797 --> 00:26:09.557
and this one,

00:26:11.117 --> 00:26:11.676
and this one.

00:26:15.476 --> 00:26:16.357
How about this one?

00:26:16.597 --> 00:26:17.077
Look.

00:26:17.516 --> 00:26:18.597
It's for spring attire.

00:26:19.157 --> 00:26:21.117
This woman has acquainted herself

00:26:21.317 --> 00:26:22.397
with our entire family.

00:26:23.877 --> 00:26:24.357
No.

00:26:25.516 --> 00:26:26.597
I need another plan.

00:26:28.317 --> 00:26:29.436
Bad news, young master.

00:26:29.676 --> 00:26:30.916
Mr. Dongyang is missing.

00:26:31.756 --> 00:26:32.117
What?

00:26:32.196 --> 00:26:32.676
What?

00:26:32.797 --> 00:26:33.276
What?

00:26:34.436 --> 00:26:35.276
(The Grand Tutor)

00:26:35.436 --> 00:26:36.597
(said that Jia Xun has)

00:26:36.716 --> 00:26:38.792
(a red crescent-shaped birthmark
on his lower back.)

00:26:38.877 --> 00:26:40.637
(Xue Nuannuan is clearly a girl.)

00:26:40.877 --> 00:26:42.597
(Let me check if you have it.)

00:26:44.872 --> 00:26:45.512
Nothing.

00:26:49.916 --> 00:26:51.117
What are you doing?

00:26:52.956 --> 00:26:54.117
