That's why we're here together. You and me.

Yeong Ran.

00:02:14.638 --> 00:02:19.805
It feels like you've changed a bit

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:21.672
after you came back from Muchang.

00:02:21.672 --> 00:02:24.938
You used to be indifferent
and not care about people.

He's such a good person.

That's exactly why I shouldn't like him.

The news says

00:04:35.805 --> 00:04:38.805
Ms. Yeong Ran is a bad person,

00:04:40.938 --> 00:04:44.772
but actually, she's a good person.

Why can't you do anything?

00:05:28.472 --> 00:05:32.372
Just being there for her
when she's struggling is already a huge help.

If we stay, all three of us
will get caught, Madam.

Dong Min is also my brother.

00:53:38.572 --> 00:53:42.838
You need to leave, so we can save Dong Min.

00:53:42.838 --> 00:53:46.405
No, I'll get him out no matter what.

00:53:46.405 --> 00:53:48.472
Let's go, Madam.

The autopsy results show that the cause of death
was head trauma from a gunshot.

Who's the perpetrator?

00:56:17.838 --> 00:56:21.338
The suspect was caught at the scene
and is currently being transported to Seoul.

00:56:30.138 --> 00:56:32.172
The USB was completely destroyed,

00:56:32.172 --> 00:56:35.138
and Ho Se committed suicide there.

00:56:35.138 --> 00:56:36.538
What about Ho Se's body?

00:56:36.538 --> 00:56:41.572
There was nothing to verify his identity,
so he was sent to a morgue for unclaimed bodies.

00:56:42.738 --> 00:56:44.705
He was quite useful though.

Kim Yeong Ran and Lee Don fled immediately,

00:56:47.238 --> 00:56:51.038
