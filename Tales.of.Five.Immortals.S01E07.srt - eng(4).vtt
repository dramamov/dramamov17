00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.840
Enter

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.280
Officer Gu

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:16.159
Think carefully

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:18.239
Come find me

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.680
Better than following Bai Xiaojie

00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:27.560
Even those who shouldn't come are here

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.920
If I don't come

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.040
Who knows what schemes you'd plot

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:41.719
Bai Xiaojie

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:44.280
Are you so

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:46.359
Lacking in confidence?

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:55.519
Calm down

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:57.079
Let's get to business

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.920
We've found a lead

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.480
We need your help, Officer Gu

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.000
What did you find? Tell me

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.400
The cases of Hu and the magician

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.199
Share one crucial link

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.879
They're connected to one person

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.759
Ziyan

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:18.120
Ziyan

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.719
Ziyan

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.879
That dancer who died

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:32.719
I recall it was just suicide

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:34.240
Her case was ordinary

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.639
The scene was clean too

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:38.479
I must remind you

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.639
The three-day deadline approaches

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.360
If by tomorrow night

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.400
You haven't found the killer

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.240
I'll take her away

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.960
How many times must I say

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:51.319
I'm not the killer

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.039
If you cops can't solve it

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:54.199
Why blame us?

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:03.759
Are you lecturing me?

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.360
One day

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:07.879
Just one day

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.599
I still need to find someone

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:16.199
Have you seen this?

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.319
Thank you, sir

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.800
You're so wicked

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.639
Call

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.439
Raise

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.840
Qian Gongzi, I...

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:50.039
It's you

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:52.319
Who's this? You know him?

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:55.599
Would I know such lowlifes?

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:00.719
Not here for you

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.159
Qian Gongzi

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:04.919
Do you know Miss Ziyan?

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.360
Sister Ziyan, you're so lucky

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.719
Close your eyes, hold out your hand

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.879
I folded this myself

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:22.439
Do you like it?

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:24.399
I do

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:33.360
Wait, who are you?

00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:35.920
Babbling nonsense here

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:39.680
With your meager coins

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.360
You can't even buy in

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.480
Stop pretending to be rich

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:44.279
Get lost

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.399
Who says he's broke?

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.040
My money is his money

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:53.480
This should cover the buy-in

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.800
Xiaowei

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:57.839
Qian Gongzi

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.360
Your aura shows death's shadow

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.439
Reeks of impending doom

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.079
Ziyan has marked you

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:10.319
What nonsense is this?

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:11.720
I speak the truth

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:14.879
Debts must be repaid

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.079
Ziyan died with grievances

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:20.360
Two have died already

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.759
You're next

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:35.120
If you're so powerful

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:37.600
Can predict spirits and gods

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:41.240
Then

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:44.399
What card am I holding?

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.720
Can you tell me that?

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.399
I lack such skills

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:55.519
Then admit you're a fraud

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:57.480
Crawl around the table

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.879
Bark like a dog

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.720
If it amuses me

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.279
I might let you go

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:03.879
Right, brother?

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.319
Ace of Spades

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:16.560
Ace of Spades!

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:20.040
Mine's Five of Diamonds

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:33.920
Well, do you believe me now?

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:37.279
Truly, heroes emerge from the young.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.480
Let's make it official.

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:39.920
How about a game of dice?

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:44.480
Why waste time with him?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.680
Brother Heng.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.199
If I win, I want all your chips.

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:50.160
You win.

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:52.600
Let's hear how you can help me.

00:06:53.959 --> 00:06:55.959
This young master Qian is quite calculating.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.839
So according to you,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.360
there's no benefit for us either way.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.839
Let's go, we won't play with him.

00:07:01.079 --> 00:07:02.920
What does his life or death matter to us?

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:05.199
So, do you want to bet or not?

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.199
I'll bet.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.839
That Laifu seems to have some tricks up his sleeve.

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:22.600
I think he's pretending to be crazy.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.079
The whole casino is under our control.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.560
He can't play any tricks.

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:35.040
Young master Qian, young master Sun.

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:43.839
I want him to lose miserably.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.560
Understood?

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:46.839
Understood.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.000
You always use my money to play the hero.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.360
Let me tell you something.

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.160
I'm keeping track of all the money you owe me.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.560
Isn't the three-day deadline almost up?

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.759
I'm worried something might happen to you.

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:04.800
If something happens to you, my lead is gone.

00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:06.240
Then coming to Harbin would be for nothing.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.360
You...

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.399
Miss Bai.

00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:13.639
Don't worry.

00:08:14.279 --> 00:08:16.360
As long as you help me find the photo clue,

00:08:16.759 --> 00:08:18.000
I'll pay you back all the money.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.639
If I can't pay in one year, I'll take two.

00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:22.120
If not in two, then three.

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:24.480
After all, I'm your fiancÃ©.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.680
I'll pay you back slowly.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.759
You... always full of big talk.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.519
Just play along with them casually.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.279
At worst, I'll just bet you.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:33.200
You wouldn't dare.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.000
Don't worry, nothing will happen.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:36.679
Let's go.

00:08:44.279 --> 00:08:45.240
It's your first time at a casino.

00:08:45.399 --> 00:08:46.279
I won't take advantage of you.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.440
Let's play dice.

00:08:47.639 --> 00:08:49.519
One each, higher number wins.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:50.720
Fine.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.600
Then let's not waste time.

00:08:53.039 --> 00:08:53.720
One round only.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.000
Come on.

00:09:23.919 --> 00:09:25.639
Lucky, it's a tie.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:26.679
Again.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.919
This isn't getting us anywhere.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:50.879
How about this.

00:09:51.759 --> 00:09:52.919
Let's see who gets the lower number.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.080
We said higher number wins.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.600
How can you just change the rules?

00:09:57.919 --> 00:09:58.720
What's wrong with changing?

00:09:59.200 --> 00:09:59.679
What?

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.519
Higher number can win,

00:10:01.639 --> 00:10:02.679
but lower number can't?

00:10:28.799 --> 00:10:29.559
Come on, gentlemen.

00:10:29.919 --> 00:10:30.600
Your turn.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.120
Are you scared?

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.360
Or can't you roll it?

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.399
With these loaded dice,

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.840
of course you can't roll a one.

00:10:54.639 --> 00:10:58.120
Who would have thought the famous young master Sun

00:10:58.919 --> 00:11:01.279
would resort to such dirty tricks.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.240
If he wins, he wins.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.320
It's not like I can't afford to lose this small amount.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.480
I said I'm not playing for money.

00:11:12.159 --> 00:11:12.840
Go ahead.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.279
What do you want?

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.279
When it comes down to it,

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.840
she's just a wandering ghost.

00:11:18.919 --> 00:11:19.600
When she was alive,

00:11:19.759 --> 00:11:21.440
she was just a second-rate dancer.

00:11:21.879 --> 00:11:23.519
Dreaming of marrying into our Qian family.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.120
Good riddance she's dead.

00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:26.360
You...

00:11:34.559 --> 00:11:35.519
Tonight,

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.240
sleep in Ziyan's room for one night.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.759
That's all.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.039
Just that simple.

00:11:42.159 --> 00:11:42.960
But,

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.080
no matter what happens,

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.240
don't open the door.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:35.960
Is anyone there?

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.600
I'm thirsty.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.639
No matter what happens,

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.480
don't open the door.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.080
Going out for some water

00:13:01.279 --> 00:13:02.639
shouldn't be a problem, right?

00:13:21.879 --> 00:13:23.080
Namo Amituofo

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.080
Taishang Laojun

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.200
May Guanyin Bodhisattva bless us

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.840
All deities, please forgive us

00:13:28.399 --> 00:13:29.240
All deities
