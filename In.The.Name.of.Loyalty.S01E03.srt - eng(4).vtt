00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.159
You dropped this.

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:37.079
Don't worry.

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:39.000
Since I dismissed all servants,

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.920
I mean you no harm.

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:45.479
Who sent you here?

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.320
You rule with ignorance

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.079
and spill innocent blood.

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:50.280
Today,

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:51.719
I came to take

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:52.719
your worthless life

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:54.200
for those you killed.

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:55.640
You're right.

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:57.280
I deserve death.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.840
I have just one request.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.640
As my waiting maid,

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:06.280
dress me in that garment.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.519
And my life is yours.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.480
(He's figured out my intention.)

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.519
(Yet he saved me anyway.)

00:01:58.599 --> 00:01:59.280
Why would you

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.000
wear this bloody garment?

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:03.640
Every stain here

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.000
belongs to loyal subjects

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.519
who died for me.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.840
Wearing this,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.280
I'll face them

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:13.000
with dignity in the afterlife.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.400
Today,

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.199
I'll kill you!

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.400
It's fine.

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:36.479
(The Frost Poison again.)

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.800
(The Emperor hides many secrets.)

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:40.560
(I can't let him die yet.)

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.800
Guards!

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.520
Guards!

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:55.080
Your Grace.

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.800
Your Grace.

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:01.400
Your Grace.

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.680
I haven't even come to punish you yet,

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.759
yet you come to me now.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.280
Punish me later if you must.

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:08.599
Please save His Majesty.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.120
What happened?

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.960
His Majesty has fallen ill.

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:14.039
It's critical.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.240
Hurry!

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:16.080
Turn back!

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.759
Yes.

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:20.599
What tea?

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:23.120
Your Grace.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.360
It's the antidote
from the Prince Regent.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.479
These two maids always deliver it.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.680
The Prince Regent said

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.280
the tea should be served on time.

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:33.360
Serve the tea

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.599
immediately!

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:35.719
Your Grace,

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:36.960
it's not time yet.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.879
Serve it,

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.680
and the Prince Regent will punish me.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.039
Have mercy, Your Grace.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.039
I-I'll prepare it now.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.039
What's really happening?

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.759
Your Majesty.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.800
You handled this well.

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:00.919
I'll spare you this time.

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:03.360
But if you dare

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.759
have treacherous thoughts,

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.439
your death will be excruciating.

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:09.879
I wouldn't dare.

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:15.680
You may leave.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.399
I'll attend to His Majesty alone.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.879
Your Majesty,

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.160
are you feeling better?

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.680
(Is all this)

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.120
(heaven's punishment?)

00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:46.279
Who sent the antidote last night?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.680
Your Majesty,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.040
it was the new waiting maid

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:51.800
who sought help from Her Grace.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.759
Cheng Ge?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.759
Summon her.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.040
Yes.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.000
Why summon me?

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.040
If you wanted me dead,

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.160
why saved me last night?

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.040
I balance debts clearly.

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:17.800
You saved me from the Empress,

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:19.279
and I repaid that debt.

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:20.959
We're even.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.240
But

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:23.920
don't think saving you once

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.519
means I won't kill you later.

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:28.040
If you want to kill me,

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:30.759
you had plenty of chances

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:32.439
while I slept just now.

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:34.279
I guess

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.480
you must have questions for me.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.160
Go ahead.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.720
What's the question?

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.959
The Pingxiang rebellion.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.279
Back then,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.399
the people of Pingxiang
rose against Shi Nan,

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:58.639
the late Emperor.

00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:01.399
For the greater good,

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:02.360
I granted them amnesty.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.000
Preposterous lies!

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:06.399
On the very day you ascended the throne,

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:07.920
you sent troops

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.839
to massacre Pingxiang!

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.639
Weren't the people

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.959
of Pingxiang victims of a flood?

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.040
Flood?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.920
Gao Ji must have forged

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.839
the imperial rescript

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.600
and issued false decrees.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.879
These are just your claims.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.319
How can I trust you?

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.759
If you doubt me,

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.920
you may kill me anytime.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.040
But you'll never avenge

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.879
the people of Pingxiang.

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:38.839
I might as well kill you now

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:40.680
and then the Prince Regent.

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:42.759
If he was so easily killed,

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:45.920
what do you think I've been doing

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:47.399
all these years?

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.600
If you still doubt,

00:06:55.519 --> 00:06:57.279
stay as a waiting maid.

00:06:58.199 --> 00:06:59.759
I'll keep your identity hidden.

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:02.399
Then you'll witness

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:04.639
how today's court

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.560
truly operates.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.040
But if I discover

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:11.759
you're deceiving me...

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:15.600
You can kill me anytime.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.439
Your Grace.

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:19.560
Your Grace.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.439
Why did you poison Shi Yu?

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.279
Everything I do

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.920
is for your sake.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.560
In my opinion,

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:34.160
you did it for yourself.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.279
How dare you!

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:40.040
You became the Empress
by marrying Shi Yu

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.800
only because you're my sister.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.000
I grew up with him.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.199
Our marriage was destined.

00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:46.399
Now look.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.759
The entire palace obeys you anyway.

00:07:49.439 --> 00:07:50.720
If you wish,

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.399
just take the throne yourself.

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:54.160
Outrageous!

00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:18.279
To achieve greatness,

00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:20.920
don't lose sight of the big picture.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.079
Compassion of a woman

00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:29.360
ruins everything.

00:08:42.528 --> 00:08:43.456
(When to act)

00:08:43.759 --> 00:08:45.000
(If the Pingxiang rebellion)

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.320
(was truly another's scheme,)

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.240
(wouldn't killing him)

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:49.879
(empower the villain?)

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.840
(Besides, he seems)

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.480
(truly pitiful.)

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.759
Her Grace summons you.

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:00.200
