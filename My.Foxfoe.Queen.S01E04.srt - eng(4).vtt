00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.460
So you really are a fox demon.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.860
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.339
This is the Demon-locking Rope.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.860
It will lock any demon tightly
once it senses demonic power.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.219
Then you are a demon,

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.419
why doesn't it lock you?

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.700
Stop quibbling.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.580
Show your true form at once.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.540
You want to see my true form?

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:38.739
Sure.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.540
Then you can strip me naked.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.660
I don't have hands right now,
it's inconvenient.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.419
What did you say?

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.740
I said,

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.380
you're dressed so provocatively,

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.179
and you've hung me up like this.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.460
You wouldn't be trying
to do something to me, would you?

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.780
You really have some nerve.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.380
Not afraid of being seen here
by outsiders.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.100
Ah.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.260
You're fainting already?

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.260
Can you not?

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.780
Something's wrong.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.539
I only have a fragment of my soul now.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.860
I have no demonic power either.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.860
Why would
the Demon-locking Rope lock me?

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.660
Could it be...

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.619
So it really is because of this.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.620
I don't need magic then, right?

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.739
Use this.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.660
It can still take your inner core.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.020
Why is

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.340
his heart chamber so hard?

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.300
So cold.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.620
Where am I?

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.860
I went to the wrong place.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.539
(Xiling Xuan's Heart Chamber)

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.060
Why is his heart

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.100
wrapped in solid ice?

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.780
The inner core.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.060
It's so hard.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.500
Looks like to take his inner core,

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.260
I have to melt all this ice first.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.380
What are you doing?

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.660
Doing what?

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.660
Of course, to make you pay
for what you've done.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.620
What?

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.860
You...

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.340
Your Lordship, you're awake.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.259
You demoness!

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.660
Dared to burn me!

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.500
I never burned you!

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:20.219
Your Lordship.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.260
Did you have a nightmare?

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.980
A nightmare?

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.539
This morning,

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.059
I was walking in the rear garden

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.739
and saw you collapsed in the grass.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.940
So I helped you back up.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.139
You kept shouting about catching demons.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.539
Had a nightmare, right?

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.460
But last night in Xuantian Cave,

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.660
you were clearly locked
by the Demon-locking Rope.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.940
I was in the palace hall all night.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.539
Besides, I drank the Emperor's
Demon-revealing Potion.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.900
So why are you still calling me a demon?

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.780
Sorry, Your Highness.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.660
I was not in my right mind.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.259
(Yes.)

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.140
(Luckily you weren't
in your right mind.)

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.380
(Otherwise I really couldn't have fixed it.)

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.580
It's okay.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.619
What happened yesterday was so scary.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.260
Anyone would be shaken.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.700
It's normal that you reacted this way.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.700
How could I blame you?

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.140
(Can't even burn through it.)

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.140
(Looks like I need another way.)

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.419
Rest well for now.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.300
I will visit you another day.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.460
Why is there a burnt smell?

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.019
Your Lordship.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.860
His Majesty summons you to the study.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.620
Understood.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.060
I'm coming right away.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.300
Your Highness, you should take medicine.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.939
I'm fine.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.060
No need to take it.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.539
That won't do.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.379
His Majesty specifically instructed it.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.779
Your Highness, you caught a cold
some days ago,

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.900
and you must take some
warming medicinal soup.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.260
(Warming medicinal soup?)

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:11.940
(Exactly.)

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.579
(Since the fire can't get in,)

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.900
(why not let him warm himself
from inside?)

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.219
Do you have any medicine

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.060
that makes a man's whole body warm
after drinking?

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.660
Makes a man's whole body warm?

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.260
A warmth that comes from deep inside.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.380
(Isn't that the Hehuan Powder?)

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.779
(The Empress must be grateful
for His Majesty's care,)

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.980
(wanting to bear His Majesty
a little prince.)

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.260
(The Empress is just too shy
to say it directly.)

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.419
I understand, of course I have it.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.260
I'll get it for you right away.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.860
Why is she laughing?

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.860
Killed 306 Yao Mountain snake demons.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.499
All their inner cores are here.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.940
Please take a look.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.260
As a demon,

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.060
you slaughtered your own kind.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.900
You really are a bastard.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:55.740
No.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.500
You're a beast.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.460
After all, back then,

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.780
you personally killed your own Mother.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:26.780
Your Majesty.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.180
Brother.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:30.980
You're finally awake.

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:34.060
Why am I here?

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.180
I lost control again.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.180
It's okay.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.219
It's all over now.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.700
All over?

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.300
It's all over now.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.900
This time,

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.100
how many people did I kill?

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:00.980
A whole village.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.220
No.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.060
That village never really existed.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.700
You did nothing.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.220
You did nothing.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:09.940
You're fine.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:11.900
You're fine.

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:14.459
Your Majesty.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.700
It's okay.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.340
I'm a demon.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.980
I killed so many people again.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.859
I deserve to die.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.100
I really deserve to die.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.060
It's okay.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.900
My inner core is gone.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.500
I'm going to die.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.260
I don't want to die.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:35.780
Wait a moment.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.019
With my half core protecting you,

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.459
even if you face great danger
in the future,

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:12.860
you will not die.

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:15.779
Thank you.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.180
I'll remember you.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.060
(Tushan Yue)

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.459
