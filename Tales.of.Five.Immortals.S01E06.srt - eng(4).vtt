00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.280
With red makeup on my face,

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.439
I'll be your bride.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.759
A willow branch I break,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.120
to stay by your side.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.039
Borrowing a ray of sunlight,

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:34.400
to warm my heart.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.000
With red makeup on my face,

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.080
I'll be your bride.

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:40.280
Ziyan.

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:41.960
It wasn't me who wanted to bother you.

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:44.000
It was those two who made me come here.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.479
If you want to take someone, take them.

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:47.120
Don't take me, sis.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.560
What...

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:07.000
What's going on?

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:14.599
This is Mirage Powder.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.920
Mirage Powder?

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.480
It seems someone's afraid Ziyan will be forgotten,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.079
so they pulled these tricks.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.160
What does this have to do with me?

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.279
I have no grudge against her.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.120
If she came back, she'd look for Hong Jie.

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:29.680
Why would she look for me?

00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:32.839
Hong Jie?

00:04:35.079 --> 00:04:35.680
Well...

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:38.600
Boss Hu was originally Hong Jie's client.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.360
Ziyan stole him away.

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:43.759
Hong Jie hated her with a passion.

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:45.279
She wished she could eat her alive.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.079
With Ziyan dead,

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:49.360
Hong Jie was the happiest.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.199
But being happy was useless.

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:53.240
The clients Ziyan had spoiled

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:55.319
wouldn't go back to her.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.720
Hong Jie hated Ziyan's guts.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
With red makeup, I'll be your bride.

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:10.279
Break a willow branch to stay by your side.

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:12.079
Borrowing a ray of sunlight...

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:14.959
That voice doesn't sound like a ghost.

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:16.879
Let's go check it out.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:23.000
Waiting for you, when flowers bloom again.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.680
A folded crane to go with you afar.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.079
Ziyan! Ziyan's back!

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:34.199
No...

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:35.480
Why is she wearing Ziyan's dress?

00:05:35.519 --> 00:05:36.399
Hong Jie.

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:38.639
Ziyan often sang this song too.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.639
Could Ziyan have really come back?

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:41.959
Hong Jie.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.079
Is Hong Jie going crazy?

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:45.240
This is so scary.

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:46.839
Hong Jie, wake up!

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.519
Hong Jie!

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.160
Hong Jie, are you okay?

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.040
How is she?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.560
Hong Jie.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.879
Hong Jie, wake up!

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:07.480
Hong Jie!

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:08.399
Let me help you up, Hong Jie.

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:13.519
Ziyan's paper crane.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.720
Ziyan, you little witch!

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.959
You fought me for men when you were alive.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.240
You won't even let me rest now that you're dead.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.040
What does you being dumped have to do with me?

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:27.759
If you've got the guts, go after the man!

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.480
Ziyan was dumped by a man?

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:32.120
Didn't Ziyan commit suicide?

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.319
I'm afraid this isn't that simple.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.040
Why would she kill herself for no reason?

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.879
She just had ambitions that were too high.

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:41.720
Men come and go in nightclubs.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.720
It's all just an act.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.920
Did she really think someone would marry us?

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.240
What was she thinking?

00:06:50.079 --> 00:06:51.600
Ziyan, let me tell you.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.639
You've got the wrong person.

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:54.439
If you dare to haunt me again,

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.000
I'll scatter your ashes.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.600
I won't let you go, even in death.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.519
Let me ask you.

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:02.040
Who did Ziyan usually interact with?

00:07:02.519 --> 00:07:03.720
You expect me to just talk?

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:05.639
Without getting anything in return?

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:09.839
It's all yours.

00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:13.639
Just tell me something useful.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.600
I'll be sure to give you business later.

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:21.680
Follow me.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.759
Back then,

00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:27.959
I was the most popular dancer at the Grand World.

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:30.120
Everyone had to call me Hong Jie.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.720
Until one day,

00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:33.800
a young girl named Ziyan arrived.

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:36.120
When Ziyan first came,

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.639
she was just a student.

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:38.759
She didn't know anything.

00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:40.160
But this girl...

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:41.800
she was truly cut out for this line of work.

00:07:42.399 --> 00:07:44.319
Talented and street-smart.

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:45.800
She learned very quickly.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.480
Hello, Hong Jie.

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:47.240
Hello.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.720
Hong Jie, you look so beautiful today.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.360
Your hair looks great today.

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:51.879
Hello, Hong Jie. Hong Jie.

00:07:56.199 --> 00:07:56.920
Hong Jie. Hong Jie.

00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:58.000
You're here! You look so beautiful today.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.199
So beautiful. Alright.

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:03.639
Hong Jie.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.040
Hong Jie.

00:08:07.519 --> 00:08:09.000
This girl is Ziyan.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.399
I'm leaving her with you.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.680
Teach her the ropes.

00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:13.480
Why did you come here?

00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:16.319
What other reason could there be?

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.720
Times are tough, just trying to get by.

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:22.560
I can still fetch a good price while I'm young.

00:08:23.399 --> 00:08:24.160
What can you do?

00:08:24.959 --> 00:08:25.639
I...

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.279
I don't know how to do anything.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.879
But I can learn.

00:08:30.439 --> 00:08:31.240
Learn?

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.799
Our line of work isn't easy to learn.

00:08:34.519 --> 00:08:37.279
You have to lose your pride and be daring.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.279
Hong Jie.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:47.759
Come with me.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.440
Go on.

00:09:08.159 --> 00:09:10.279
Ziyan was smart and young.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.919
She was a fast learner.

00:09:12.559 --> 00:09:13.840
She climbed the ranks very quickly.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.200
I hated her.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.480
I was jealous of her.

00:09:18.879 --> 00:09:19.919
But besides accepting it,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.039
there was nothing I could do.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.960
Bravo!

00:09:55.399 --> 00:09:56.639
Ziyan became more and more popular.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.039
Many clients would spend a fortune

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.399
just to see her.

00:10:01.519 --> 00:10:03.240
A saying spread among the clients.

00:10:04.159 --> 00:10:05.879
They called Ziyan the Thousand-Faced Fox.

00:10:06.879 --> 00:10:08.320
The Ziyan that everyone saw

00:10:08.919 --> 00:10:09.960
was completely different.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.360
Who hasn't been famous before?

00:10:13.159 --> 00:10:14.679
I know that feeling all too well.

00:10:16.039 --> 00:10:17.799
When everyone surrounds you,

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.759
you feel like you're just an empty shell.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.720
I filled myself with money.

00:10:25.039 --> 00:10:26.879
But Ziyan fell in love with a man.

00:10:28.159 --> 00:10:29.759
The biggest taboo in our line of work

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.759
is falling in love with a client.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.600
Ziyan crossed the line.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.159
Who is that man?

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:52.399
Who he is doesn't matter.

00:10:52.879 --> 00:10:53.759
What matters isâ€”

00:10:54.519 --> 00:10:56.879
Ziyan, to keep his love,

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.200
soon prayed for the fox spirit's blessing.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.399
Graceful white fox, with nine majestic tails.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.080
In my home, honored guests are kings.

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:10.559
May this union bring prosperity.

00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:13.679
Between heaven and man, let this be done.
