00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:09.359
Don't move.

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:10.560
It'll be done soon.

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:15.280
Don't worry,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.519
I'll get you out.

00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:18.920
Careful!

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.799
Thank you.

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:31.879
We're family.

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:35.280
Helping her is helping me.

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.359
(On the battlefield,)

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:41.480
(I've always been
the one protecting others.)

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.599
(This is the first time
someone risked his life to save me,)

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:46.400
(and it happened to be Gu Chenyu.)

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:47.519
Yunyun.

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:51.439
From today on,

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.120
I'm the head of the Gu family.

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:59.560
Congratulations.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.439
Didn't you say
you'd marry the family head?

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.319
Now I am the family head.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.359
Whatever my brother
can give you, I can too.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.319
Leave him.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.319
Be with me.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.520
You plotted to kidnap Gu Chenyu

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.560
and even wanted
to kill your own brother.

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:19.400
A position gained through
such dirty means,

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.280
don't you find it filthy?

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.159
You were kidnapped too?

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.520
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.360
Stop pretending!

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.039
Weren't those kidnappers your men?

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.080
I didn't know it'd turn out like this.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.879
I only knew someone
would stir up trouble,

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.199
so he couldn't attend the board meeting.

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.960
But I didn't know you would...

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.599
Gu Yansheng.

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:41.280
Maybe Fu Yunyun once liked you,

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:44.439
but now you're lost
in your own obsession,

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:46.879
becoming a shameless man without limits.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.599
Stop now.

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:51.599
Don't make me despise you.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.560
Why do you always side with my brother?

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.120
You help him,

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.960
you care about him,

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.599
you accuse me of taking what's his,

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.199
but he's the one who took you first!

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:03.439
He's the real despicable one!

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:04.120
Let go!

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.360
Yun...

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.840
What are you doing here?

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:42.400
Visiting the patient.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.360
And to hand over
some of the company's work.

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:47.599
After all,

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:49.879
I'm now the head of the Gu family.

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:54.280
I always thought
you had no interest in the company.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.719
I used to think

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.759
what's mine should be mine,

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:05.199
and what's not, I wouldn't want.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.639
But later I realised

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:09.960
if I keep standing still,

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:12.520
I'll just keep losing things.

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:15.080
So I had to fight.

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:17.480
Because

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.319
there's something I can never lose.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.920
Yansheng.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.680
Yunyun is already my wife.

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:32.720
So what?

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.120
The road ahead is long.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.519
One day,

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:38.839
I'll make her return to me.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.199
Since you refuse to wake up,

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.240
let me see what you're capable of.

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.920
Yunyun.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.920
Are you free tomorrow?

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:08.319
There's something

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:10.000
very important I need to tell you.

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:37.319
Muyan.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.480
Why did you ask me
to come to the film studio?

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.680
I wanted to show you a different view.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.120
There's no blood here,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.079
no war,

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.279
people live in peace and harmony.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.240
It's wonderful.

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:06.720
If only the Great Liang Empire
could be like this too.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.360
Your subordinate Zhao Muyan

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.800
greets General Nangong.

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:35.879
What did you call me?

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.120
I too come from the Great Liang
of a thousand years ago.

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:41.000
I was a captain
in the Southern Wind Camp.

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:54.839
So,

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.759
you recognised me at the auction,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.319
that's why you treated me so kindly.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.319
But...

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.800
You're…

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.040
There were so many soldiers
in the Southern Wind Camp.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.759
It's normal that you
wouldn't remember me.

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:08.720
But to me,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.720
you've always
been the person I admire most, General.

00:07:15.079 --> 00:07:15.720
Then

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.920
how did you travel here?

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.600
When you sacrificed yourself,

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.160
I took several arrows for you.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.700
(Command)

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.720
When I opened my eyes again,

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.480
I was already here.

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:45.120
Inside the body of someone
who looked like me,

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.279
Zhao Muyan.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.959
Though this world
is prosperous and advanced,

00:07:56.199 --> 00:07:57.560
I've always missed Great Liang.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.040
I miss my brothers
from the Southern Wind Camp.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.839
To see you again here, General,

00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:10.120
is truly wonderful.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:13.879
No matter where I'm,

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.759
I'll always be loyal to you.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.120
I'm not a general anymore.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.879
We're equals now.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.000
We're friends.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.600
From now on,

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:26.519
just call me by my name.

00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:28.360
Alright.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.040
Yun...

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.279
Yunyun.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.720
Then from now on,
I'll be Yunyun's trusted friend.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.720
I'll drink and talk with you,

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.399
and ease your worries.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:39.559
Alright.

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:41.840
You were one of my Southern Wind men.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:42.639
From now on,

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:45.200
as long as it's within my power,

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.600
I'll protect you.

00:08:48.519 --> 00:08:49.080
Alright.

00:08:59.759 --> 00:09:00.440
Please enjoy.

00:09:00.679 --> 00:09:01.519
Thank you.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.240
Eat up.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.120
Let's have a drink first.

00:09:17.879 --> 00:09:18.759
So...

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.639
Do you know what happened
to Great Liang afterwards?

00:09:28.519 --> 00:09:29.559
I looked it up.

00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:32.159
A thousand years ago, the rebels
broke through the Great Liang capital.

00:09:32.159 --> 00:09:33.300
They slaughtered the royal family.

00:09:35.159 --> 00:09:36.440
The Great Liang Empire was destroyed.

00:09:45.679 --> 00:09:46.480
General.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.399
Don't blame yourself.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.320
The Emperor was obsessed with alchemy
and neglected state affairs.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:52.890
Corrupt officials
seized control of the court.

00:09:53.399 --> 00:09:55.039
The Great Liang court was in chaos.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.240
Rebellions rose everywhere.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:59.390
Even if the Southern Wind Camp
had defended the capital that day,

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:01.000
what difference would it make?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.970
Would my twenty thousand soldiers
of the Southern Wind Camp

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.600
have died for nothing then?

00:10:07.799 --> 00:10:09.360
As long as there's even
a glimmer of hope,

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.519
I must return to the past.

00:10:10.519 --> 00:10:12.320
I'll do everything
I can to change history.

00:10:13.039 --> 00:10:14.720
Have you found a way to go back?

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:22.399
The original Fu Yunyun used the contract
bound to this command token

00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:23.679
to summon me here.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.679
Once I fulfill her final wish,

00:10:25.679 --> 00:10:27.720
I may have the chance
to return to the past.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.519
But before that,

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:31.080
I must continue to live as Fu Yunyun.

00:10:33.159 --> 00:10:33.720
Alright.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.759
Whatever you need to do,

00:10:36.039 --> 00:10:37.000
I'll help you.

00:10:39.399 --> 00:10:41.440
But you're not truly Fu Yunyun.

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.000
There's no reason to stay
with the Gu family

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.360
and waste time with those two brothers.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.720
Why not just divorce Gu Chenyu now?

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.800
I'll help you find a place to live.

00:10:48.279 --> 00:10:48.919
Yunyun.
