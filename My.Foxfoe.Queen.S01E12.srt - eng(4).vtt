(My brother.)

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.260
(I swear I'll never
go near your wife again.)

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.300
You kissed me and just left?

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.940
What a jerk.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.700
Could it be

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.500
that he actually likes me?

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.540
Heng.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.540
Mother.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.300
You're here.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.220
Heng.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.900
Matters of the court are important,

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.179
but you must also beware

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.779
of trouble brewing at home.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.460
Trouble?

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.100
Don't worry, Mother.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.180
Xin'er

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.500
belongs to me alone.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.220
Your Majesty.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.700
You wanted to see me?

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.619
I intend to share chambers
with the Empress.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.940
What do you think of that?

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.620
That's between you and Your Highness.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.340
How could I possibly comment?

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.540
Then, I'll give you a task.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.699
Go tell your sister-in-law

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.420
to attend to me tonight.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:54.939
You

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.300
must personally bring her to me.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.059
Your Majesty.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.179
This

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.820
might not be appropriate.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.900
What's inappropriate about it?

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.540
She's your sister-in-law,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.540
not your lover.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.820
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.180
I'll bring her right away.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.140
Don't take too long.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.500
I won't wait all night.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.460
(Is he doing this out of lust)

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.100
(or because he actually likes me?)

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.579
Your Highness.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.100
His Lordship requests to see you.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:02.739
Let him in.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:03.700
Yes, Your Highness.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.980
(What is he doing here now?)

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.020
(Is he here to apologize
for what happened earlier?)

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.820
What brings you here so late?

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.780
I'm here by His Majesty's order.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.220
He wants you to attend to him tonight.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.060
I've come to escort you.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.459
(It seems I was just imagining things.)

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.180
(He didn't even bother to apologize.)

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.379
(Xiling Xuan,)

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.900
(you are heartless.)

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.420
Fine.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.179
Then take me there, quickly.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.179
I can't wait any longer.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.420
I'm ready to give His Majesty a prince.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.100
(She's not even refusing.)

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.780
(She's actually happy about it.)

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.500
You're not the real Empress.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.659
The true Empress is already dead.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.579
That's right.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.299
That's why I took over her body

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.339
to become the Empress.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.739
Why her?

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:59.860
Why possess her?

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.379
Because I wanted to grow old

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.180
with the man I love.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.819
Yaya.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.499
Let's stay together forever.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.660
Alright?

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:10.299
Alright.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.859
Yue.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.539
We'll always be together.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.700
What was that phrase again?

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.660
Grow bold together?

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:17.779
Silly.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.739
It's grow old together.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:20.739
Oh, right.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.020
Grow old together.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.060
Do you really want to grow old with him?

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.659
He's the ruler of a kingdom.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.899
As his Empress,

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.979
I'll hold power over the realm.
What's wrong with that?

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.100
You're lying!

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.260
Xiling Xuan.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.420
You think you know me so well?

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.580
Do you even know who I really am?

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.460
Of course I do.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.179
You're the Lord Wing of Xiling Kingdom.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.779
My dear brother-in-law.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.420
Xiling Xuan.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:03.579
What are you doing?

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.220
His Majesty ordered you to serve him.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.699
I'm taking you there.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.940
Let go.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.060
Let go.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.980
Let me go!

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.099
Your Majesty.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.220
I've brought the Empress to you.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:20.900
You've done well.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.459
If Your Majesty wanted me
to attend to you,

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.700
you could have sent a servant
to deliver the message.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.179
Why send such a brute instead?

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.220
He nearly dragged me to pieces.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.500
Xin'er.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.740
When it comes to
sharing chambers with you,

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.179
I feel more assured when Lord Wing

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.539
delivers the message.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:39.579
Your Majesty.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.380
I'll take my leave.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.100
Xin'er.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.700
Tonight,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.060
let's enjoy some time together.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.020
Your Majesty.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.979
Just now,

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.539
His Lordship dragged me
all the way here.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.660
I'm covered in his sweat.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.900
If it pleases Your Majesty,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.460
I'd like to bathe first.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.500
I wouldn't want to spoil your mood.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.700
Very well.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.620
Then, we'll bathe together.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.500
Xin'er.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.100
Why are you so nervous?

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.220
I have

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.379
never bathed with Your Majesty before.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.460
It's only natural to feel nervous.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.860
Then join me more often.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.540
You'll get used to it soon enough.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.420
(I need to find a way out of this.)

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.460
Your Majesty.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:17.900
Look.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.100
Aren't these flowers beautiful?

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.220
Xin'er.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:39.700
What's wrong, Xin'er?

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:41.420
Your Majesty.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.020
Xin'er.

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:44.780
I can't breathe.

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:46.179
Xin'er.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.420
Don't scare me.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.299
The flowers...

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.620
the petals...

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:52.019
Xin'er.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.140
Petals...

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:56.820
Xin'er.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.260
Xin'er.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:08:59.499
Hang in there.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.539
I'll call for help.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.579
Guards!

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:02.379
Someone, hurry!

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:03.579
(This feeling...)

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:04.099
Quick!

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.139
(Something's wrong.)

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:05.980
Xin'er!
