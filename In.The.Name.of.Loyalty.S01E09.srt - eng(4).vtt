00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.119
My lord,

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:48.039
His Majesty was assassinated.

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:43.920
Shi Yu.

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:45.079
Shi Yu.

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:52.480
This...

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.799
Why is he still so cold?

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:55.560
Shi Yu.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.360
Come on.

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.520
Your Majesty, where were you last night?

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:12.400
Were you injured?

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:15.000
Thanks to you,

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:16.439
I'm alright now.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.520
Your Majesty, I've ordered a full
investigation into the assassin's leads.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.919
Imperial guards are also stationed
outside your chamber.

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.159
Please rest assured
and focus on recuperation.

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.800
All the maids serving you yesterday
were either dead or injured.

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:42.240
Your waiting maid

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:44.280
is quite fortunate.

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.800
I was attacked.

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:47.680
In the crisis,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.560
my Frost Poison struck again.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.000
Thankfully, Cheng Ge stepped in

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.280
and found me a safe place.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.039
That's how I survived.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.199
Your Majesty actually has

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:01.759
such a capable one by your side.

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:10.280
Lord Father,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.080
is there anything else?

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:14.719
Since Your Majesty is unharmed,

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:15.439
I shall

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.920
take my leave now.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.680
About last night,

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:27.279
thank you.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.360
Your hand...

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.800
It's fine.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.160
If you want to regain power,

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.519
your priority

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:41.680
must be curing the Frost Poison.

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:44.000
I'm fine now.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.839
You're only fine for now.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.000
What about next time? I can't guarantee

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.720
that I'll be with you
every time the poison

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.000
strikes.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.720
- What I mean is...
- Your Majesty,

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:55.319
maids and guards were all

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:56.560
properly buried yesterday.

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:09.560
- You may leave.
- Yes.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.040
I don't know what grudge

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:19.480
the assassin held,

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:22.199
causing so many
needless deaths last night.

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:29.759
Let's go. I'll take you somewhere.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.480
What is this place?

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.040
I accidentally

00:05:58.319 --> 00:05:59.480
found this old house.

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:01.360
When I'm alone,

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.639
I often come here.

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:03.959
Come in.

00:06:48.512 --> 00:06:51.616
(Spirit Tablet of Shi Nan)

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:00.879
These spirit tablets

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:03.240
are for those who died for me.

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:12.000
I choose peace in the world!

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:13.839
I'm your older brother!

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.584
(People of Pingxiang)

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:26.360
When

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.480
did you...

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.959
I don't know all their names.

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:34.360
So I use these words as substitutes.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.920
I used to think

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.399
if I survived,

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.079
Gao Ji would spare those around me.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.079
But in the end...

00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:50.480
I must take initiative.

00:07:52.965 --> 00:07:56.064
(People of Pingxiang)

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.439
Some things

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.360
must be confronted alone.

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:06.079
You're not alone.

00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:08.680
You have me.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.560
Are you sure?

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.120
There'll be no turning back.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.200
Promise me one thing, okay?

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.480
Tell me.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.120
If

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.200
something happens to me,

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.440
and you're left alone,

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.039
never let Gao Ji off.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.279
Since you agree to ally with me,

00:08:54.039 --> 00:08:54.960
from now on,

00:08:57.039 --> 00:08:58.879
I swear you'll suffer no harm.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.919
Your Majesty, we found

00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:17.799
the assassin hid
in a Wardrobe Bureau's crate

00:09:17.799 --> 00:09:19.639
to enter the palace last night.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.799
And the Wardrobe Bureau

00:09:21.159 --> 00:09:23.279
has close ties
to the Imperial Weaving House.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.360
Their spies may
have infiltrated the palace.

00:09:26.679 --> 00:09:28.720
Your Majesty, you must remain vigilant.

00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:32.720
Your Majesty, shall we
keep investigating?

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.240
Or

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.759
send someone to catch someone
for interrogation?

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.360
The information ends here.

00:09:38.679 --> 00:09:40.080
Do not let anyone else know.

00:09:40.519 --> 00:09:41.200
Besides,

00:09:41.679 --> 00:09:42.799
investigate the master

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:44.600
of Imperial Weaving House.

00:09:45.279 --> 00:09:45.879
Yes.
