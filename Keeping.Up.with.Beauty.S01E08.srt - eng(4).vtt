=Episode 8=

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:06.000
Mr. Gu.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.799
This…

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.000
This incident got a bit out of hand.

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:09.000
But don't worry.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.840
I'll make sure that old man
is dealt with properly.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.680
When I assigned you
to manage Jiangxing Hotel,

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.200
I made myself very clear.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.640
You were to treat
the senior staff with respect.

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:22.359
I just checked the personnel changes.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.079
You've replaced
quite a few people this year.

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:25.719
No, Mr. Gu,

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.079
there are reasons for that.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.959
For example,

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:29.680
the old man who attacked you earlier,

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.799
he's already over sixty.

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.150
How can he
still work as a security guard?

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.760
Naturally, younger people
are more suitable.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.400
So you decided to fill the vacancies

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.159
with your own
relatives and friends, right?

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.079
Made a nice profit, didn't you?

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:40.450
No, Mr. Gu, not at all.
That's not what happened.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.680
I only wanted

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.680
to improve the hotel's
security management.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.359
Arrange this.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.000
Ask that security guard if he's willing
to work as a gatekeeper instead.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.239
It suits his age better.

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:48.719
Yes, sir.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.040
As for you and your relatives,

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.840
you don't need to come in tomorrow.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.799
Wait, Mr. Gu,

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.879
I was only thinking
of the company's safety.

00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:57.410
What about Mr. Liu's position
as vice president?

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.799
Is former Vice President Wang
still around?

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:02.280
Yes.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.159
Give the position to him.

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.840
Understood.

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:09.199
This way, please.

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:11.280
Mr. Gu...

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.680
Out.

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:19.680
Chenyu,

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:20.599
does it hurt?

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:22.039
I'm fine.

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:25.199
You should head back with Shen Siming.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.360
Yunyun,

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:32.280
I'll leave my brother to you.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.319
You…

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.599
You're really not pressing charges
against that guard?

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.919
No one lashes out like that

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.639
unless they've been pushed to the edge.

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:53.199
I heard his grandson has autism.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.879
He's had a hard life too.

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:00.319
Oh, right.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.159
This is something
I meant to give you today.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.400
What is it?

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.599
You and Mr. Fu

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.759
used to stay in the suite
at Jiangxing Hotel.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.080
This is the room key.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.240
I've never touched his belongings.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.479
I've kept them safe all this time.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.439
If you ever miss him,

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:23.879
you can come and visit
whenever you like.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.599
I have things to do.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.720
I'm heading back to the group first.

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:32.479
See you tonight.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.280
Is he really a bad person?

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:44.319
Is he just pretending so well,

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.560
putting on an act?

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.319
Or could what happened back then

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:52.080
have had another truth behind it?

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.919
Gu Chenyu.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.199
Gu Chenyu.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:21.839
Good day, Mr. Gu.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.279
You are…

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:25.800
Mr. Gu, Secretary Shen
sent me to pick you up.

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:29.040
(Yunyun,)

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.360
(you still owe me a meal.)

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.000
(No time like the present.)

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.079
(Where are you now?)

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:40.160
Get in the car.

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.879
Go, now.

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:42.360
Get in.

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:51.120
Go!

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:55.319
Go!

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.839
Yunyun!

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:58.680
Drive!

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:06.519
Just sleep.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.639
My dear little one.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.720
Grandma?

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.600
Grandma, you're finally awake!

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.680
Grandma.

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:16.759
Grandma.

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:18.720
Who are you?

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.439
Do we know each other?

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.759
Oh, right.

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:24.360
Quick, check the time.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.360
Send someone to pick up Chenyu.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.920
School might be over by now.

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:31.000
My little Chenyu.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.399
Come quickly.

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:34.839
Grandma will sing you a song.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.879
Just sleep.

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:44.720
My dear little one.

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:48.240
Mummy loves you.

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:52.519
Mummy likes you.

00:06:15.079 --> 00:06:16.720
The board meeting is tomorrow.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.879
Since your grandmother fell ill,

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:19.720
who will take over as chairman?

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.000
We'll soon find out.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.600
How can you still be drinking here?

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.399
Mom.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.160
I'm not interested in those things.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.519
Alright, stop drinking.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.680
It's just a woman.

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:34.680
Once you become
the head of the Gu family,

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.399
you can have whatever you want.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.199
I'm talking to you, are you listening?

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:42.240
Are you really willing

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.560
to let Gu Chenyu
keep stepping on you like this?

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.079
Yansheng.

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:50.120
Look at me.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.279
Trust me.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.439
As long as you agree,

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:55.160
I promise you,

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.399
I'll make sure you
become the family head.

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:11.759
Why isn't he here yet?

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.800
Where's Chenyu?

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:20.240
I... I haven't been able to reach him.

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:23.519
Young people these days
really don't understand manners.

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:26.680
The board meeting is about to start

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.360
and Gu Chenyu is nowhere to be seen.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.399
Are we elders supposed to wait for him?

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.600
Uncle.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:38.959
You're all here.

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:41.199
Good morning,

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.519
everyone.

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:47.120
Four sixes.

00:07:49.079 --> 00:07:49.879
Four kings.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.839
Four twos.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.199
No.

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:55.920
Lost again.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.160
Are you cheating?

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.720
Enough talk, pay up.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:00.800
Deal again.

00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:03.879
Come on, one more round.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.079
Shuffle the cards quickly.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.040
Don't move.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.319
Almost done.

00:08:07.839 --> 00:08:08.399
Hurry up.

00:08:08.839 --> 00:08:09.720
Play the cards.

00:08:10.439 --> 00:08:11.560
Turn a little that way.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.720
Are you in or not, hurry.

00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:20.079
Two sixes.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.199
Two eights.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.759
Who are you with?

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.279
Tag along then.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.199
Why did you come to save me?

00:08:26.519 --> 00:08:27.800
It's none of your business.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.079
But I can't just watch you

00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:30.120
get taken.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.559
Aren't you afraid?

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:34.240
Two sixes.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:35.159
Not afraid.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:36.840
Beat him.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.399
(She's putting on a brave face again.)

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.679
Can't cover two sixes.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:40.480
I'll do it.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.519
(What are a few petty thieves to fear?)

00:08:42.639 --> 00:08:43.360
Two tens.

00:08:44.279 --> 00:08:44.840
Going to call it?

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.080
Don't worry.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.200
I will definitely get you out.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:47.919
No.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:49.919
Three fours.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:51.879
Keep up.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
You're awake.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.159
Can you untie this rope?

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.600
I'll hold them off.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.879
You find a chance to run.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.440
Who sent you?

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:06.679
I can pay double what he offered.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.559
Big talk.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.000
Think being rich makes you great?

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.919
Today we want your life,

00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:15.159
not your money.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.279
