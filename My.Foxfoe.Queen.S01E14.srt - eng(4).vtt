00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.379
There are boundaries.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.020
We shouldn't meet again.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.940
(Xiling Xuan.)

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.820
(You really think
I have no way of seeing you?)

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.060
Your Highness.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.220
Here's what you asked for.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.220
Good.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.499
You may rest now.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.339
Unless I call for you,

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.620
don't come in.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.140
Your Highness, it's already so late.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.740
What are you still doing up?

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.899
In a while,

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.699
two of my friends are coming over.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.619
I plan to give them a proper welcome.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.819
Your friends?

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.940
Mm.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.979
Off you go.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.779
My friends don't have the best tempers.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.939
If they see a stranger,
things might get messy.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:09.819
Oh.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.940
Yes, Your Highness.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.700
(Xiling Xuan.)

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.420
(You may have saved me with your blood,)

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.619
(but the blood feud of my clan)

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.900
(will not go unavenged.)

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.179
Your Lordship.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.579
Something's wrong.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.699
What happened?

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.539
The Empress said

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.060
two of her friends are
coming to see her tonight.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.539
But aren't her friends

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.020
all demons?

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.420
(What is she up to this time?)

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.339
It's fine.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.820
Just keep an eye on her.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.860
As long as she doesn't
come looking for me.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.140
Yes, Your Lordship.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.579
Who's there?

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.820
Who's out there?

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.620
A demon!

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.980
A demon!

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.539
Why are you so late?

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.299
Carp and I are starving.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.979
There was a small delay.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:32.939
Thank you for waiting.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.099
So, the palace is really as you said?

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.939
Full of delicious things to eat?

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:37.939
Don't worry.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.899
I know this palace inside and out.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.420
Tell me, White Tiger and Carp,

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.820
what would you like to try?

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.059
It's true, Your Lordship.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.539
We really saw demons!

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.299
When I walked through the corridor,

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.699
I saw a tiger.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.939
When I drew water,

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.659
the entire well turned red with blood.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.859
And inside that well,

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.700
there seemed to be a huge fish.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.700
(Could it really be true?)

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.579
Your Lordship!

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.059
I saw them!

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.220
I really saw them!

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.179
There were two!

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.939
A tiger demon

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:07.979
and a carp demon.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.099
I even heard them say

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.940
they're going to eat humans tonight.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.979
Where are they now?

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.460
Over at the old palace.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.499
Stay here.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.820
Lock all the doors and windows.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:19.979
Don't go out.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.100
Yes, Your Lordship.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.300
(Could this be a summoning circle?)

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.700
Got you.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.859
Yue, aren't you supposed to be smart?

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.499
How did you walk straight into a trap?

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.899
You were crying so hard just now.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.579
Humans are terrible.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.500
They are even more cunning than foxes.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.659
A trap that can make
a little fox cry like that

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.739
needs a special name

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.379
that really stands out.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.339
How about

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.539
"The Little Fox's Tears"?

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.900
Stop making fun of me!

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.499
"The Little Fox's Tears"?

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.499
You crybaby bird!

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.100
I'll show you who's laughing!

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.620
"The Little Fox's Tears"?

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.540
You...

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.500
You are actually

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.020
Yaya?

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.620
You are mistaken.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.739
I'm not Yaya.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.020
But you just said
"The Little Fox's Tears".

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.060
Only Yaya would know about that.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.620
Your Highness.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.220
You're holding a knife.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.220
Are you going to kill me?

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.700
If you don't explain yourself,
I'll kill you right now!

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.620
Go ahead.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.220
Kill me.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.820
What I said earlier was about

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.580
the tiger and the carp.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.220
What?

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.500
I heard that tonight,

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.299
a tiger and a carp demon

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.980
plan to devour people in the palace.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.300
So, I came here to catch them.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.779
As for what you said

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.460
about the Little Fox's Tears,

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:33.780
Your Highness,

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.420
you must have misheard me.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.060
Perhaps this Yaya means a lot to you.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.820
But I am truly not him.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.820
You really misheard.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.299
Since there are no demons here,

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.460
then I

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.060
will take my leave.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.100
(Yue.)

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.220
(Maybe it's better this way.)

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.380
(At least we can live in peace.)

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.020
(Could I really be mistaken?)

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.419
(But he and Yaya)

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.300
(have so many things in common.)

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.539
Ten Directions Heavenly Venerates.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.260
All beings are like grains of sand.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:18.780
Yue.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.700
(But if he really were Yaya,)

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.540
(how could he have slaughtered
my entire fox clan?)

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.619
(He even took
the last half of my inner core)

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:29.699
(from my body.)

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.420
(His Lordship isn't an evil demon.)

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.819
He's been ill since childhood.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.220
At times, he loses control for no reason.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.460
During those moments,

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.899
(he's done many things
he shouldn't have.)

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.740
(But it was never his intention.)

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.980
(Could it be)

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.420
(that Liusu was telling the truth?)
