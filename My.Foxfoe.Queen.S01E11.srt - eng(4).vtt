00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:20.900
Xiling Xuan.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.020
I've warned you time and time again.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.420
But you never seem to have any remorse.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.179
You've crossed the line
with your sister-in-law.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.140
What you've done is beyond decency.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.300
Do you really think
I can't deal with you?

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.940
Xiling Xuan.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.500
I never wanted things to come to this.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.580
I've given you plenty of chances.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.900
But you keep making the same mistakes.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.700
You've truly let me down.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.300
I know this punishment won't change you.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.100
But, I want you
to remember how it feels.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.580
You must be feeling

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.500
a lot of pain.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.180
If you dare go near
your sister-in-law again,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.100
I won't hesitate
to let her share your pain.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.340
Your Majesty.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.020
You have my word

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.980
that I'll never
approach Her Highness again.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.220
That's my good brother.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.020
(Yue.)

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.180
(To keep you safe,)

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.180
(I can never let you find out)

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.820
(that I am Yaya.)

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.500
Your Lordship.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.300
Are you all right?

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.700
Liusu.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.100
Take good care of the Empress.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.300
She's still weak.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.499
She needs time to recover.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.700
But what about you, Your Lordship?

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.500
I'll be fine.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.340
I'll be fine.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.500
Your Lordship.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.100
I don't understand.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.139
Why did your attitude toward her

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.900
change so suddenly?

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.980
Just remember this.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.380
She matters more than anything to me

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.500
in this life.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.300
Understood, Your Lordship.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.139
From this day on,

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.419
she will also be

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.700
the one I cherish the most.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.180
Keep her safe.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.700
Do everything you can for her.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.660
Don't let anyone hurt her.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.100
Rest assured, Your Lordship.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.540
I'll remember that.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.180
That can't be right.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.779
Last night,

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.020
I clearly...

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.179
Your Highness,

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.700
you're finally awake.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.419
Wasn't I injured
by Xiling Xuan last night?

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.900
Why am I all healed now?

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.899
It was His Lordship.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.940
He used the blood
from his wrist to save you.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.780
(Why would Xiling Xuan save me?)

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.100
(Hasn't he always wanted me dead?)

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.780
Where is he now?

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.740
His Lordship is...

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.579
You shouldn't go looking for him.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.619
How could I not?

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.779
That vile demon hurt
so many people last night.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:02.579
I have to find him.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.700
Your Highness.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.300
His Lordship isn't a demon.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.540
Liusu.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.700
Wasn't he the one
who murdered your family?

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.900
Do you not want me
to avenge your family?

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.219
Your Highness,

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.059
I...

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.419
I only wish what's best for you.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.979
And for His Lordship too.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.740
Please don't go to him.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.500
Liusu, get up.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.500
Sit down.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.700
Liusu,

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.300
you're a good girl.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.660
But I really don't get it.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.500
Why would you still serve him?

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.500
So, you already knew.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.300
I saw through

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.980
your little tricks.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.140
I grew up with His Lordship
since we were little.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.779
He's gentle by nature.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.100
He's no demon.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.379
But he's hurt so many people.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.539
His Lordship has been ill
since he was a boy.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.139
Sometimes he loses control
for no apparent reason.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.139
During those times,

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.619
he's done things he shouldn't have.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.500
But it was never his intent.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.740
He told you all that, didn't he?

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.100
Your Highness.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.739
Please believe me.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.900
He's not what you think he is.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.100
I know exactly
what kind of person he is.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.580
Better than you ever could.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.579
Your Lordship.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.900
It's me.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.700
Your Lordship.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.419
Liusu told me

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.059
that you saved me last night.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.180
So I came to express my gratitude.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.980
There's no need for that.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.460
Please, go back.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.140
Why won't you even let me see you?

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.100
If you dare go near
your sister-in-law again,

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.540
I won't hesitate
to let her share your pain.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.540
Your Highness.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.460
You and I are bound by family ties.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.660
You should go back.

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.059
But you saved me.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.340
I can't just leave
without thanking you properly.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:34.940
(Yue.)

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.340
(I'm sorry.)

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.740
(I can't see you again.)

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.980
(Why won't he see me all of a sudden?)

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.579
(If this keeps up,)

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.980
(how can I kiss him?)

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.779
You hurt some people last night.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.259
No one can treat them now.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.979
They're waiting outside the city.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.459
If you really think all this

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.900
has nothing to do with you,

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.540
then stay locked in this room forever.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.499
Look.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.539
The scar's gone.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.780
He's like a living divine.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:25.139
Our savior!

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.379
You saved our lives!

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.539
Thank you, kind spirit.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.859
You saved our whole village.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.500
Thank you, heavenly one.

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:32.900
Please wait, divine one.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.419
Thank you for helping us.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.419
There are still children
who need treatment.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.379
Would you come with me to help them?

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.380
Lead the way.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:59.379
You've saved so many people today.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.260
Looks like Liusu was right.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.340
Your Lordship truly has a kind heart.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.340
So, you already knew it was me.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.140
Isn't this place beautiful?

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.340
It is.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.140
Why did Your Highness bring me here?

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.940
Well, you refused to see me.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:38.900
I just want to ask.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.180
Why did you save me last night?

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.780
The wounded are healed now.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.740
I should be going.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.259
Don't tell me you saved me

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.580
because you like me.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:00.979
Yue.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.579
Why do you always like playing with me?

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:03.779
Because you're fun.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:04.459
That's not it.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.579
You like me, don't you?

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:06.419
Silly boy.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.779
You do like me.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.339
When I grow up, I'm going to marry you.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.340
We'll talk about that
when you've actually grown up.
