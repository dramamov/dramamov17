00:00:40.896 --> 00:00:41.439
Stop.

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:47.920
You,

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.880
get in.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.920
Last night,

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:09.439
thank you.

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.480
I mean the Empress.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.519
I didn't expect

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.879
you to be that clever

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:17.879
to fool her.

00:01:19.519 --> 00:01:20.560
Just a delaying tactic.

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:22.528
Now,

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:23.879
all my trusted aides

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.079
have perished.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.239
Can you stay and help me?

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:31.079
You can't even protect yourself now.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.239
Only by reclaiming power

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:35.280
can I avenge wronged officials

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:37.000
and the people of Pingxiang.

00:01:42.272 --> 00:01:43.239
So you agree?

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.144
Why do you think

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.439
I'd cooperate with a philanderer?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.920
That was an accident.

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:52.359
Though I often mess with women,

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:53.280
actually, I...

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.959
Enough!

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.959
Never mention it again.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.519
If you lay a finger on me again,

00:01:59.616 --> 00:02:01.184
I'll castrate you alive.

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:04.640
Okay.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.799
Okay.

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:18.848
What's that smell on you?

00:02:19.328 --> 00:02:20.256
Why so fragrant?

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:22.240
Marinated specially to kill you.

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:28.039
Now I've not only failed my mission,

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.759
but also...

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.000
Actually,

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.360
it was also my first time.

00:02:45.856 --> 00:02:46.319
Master,

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.960
Cheng Ge hasn't succeeded
after days in the palace,

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.080
nor has any message come back.

00:02:51.712 --> 00:02:53.000
Could something have gone wrong?

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:54.280
Contact her.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.520
Tell her to accelerate.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.439
No more delays.

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:57.919
Understood.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.984
(What am I doing?)

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:07.599
(What has that)

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:08.400
(to do with me?)

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.952
(I'm here)

00:03:09.952 --> 00:03:12.159
(bearing the grievances
of Pingxiang's people.)

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.080
(Cheng Ge,)

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.879
(don't overthink.)

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.240
Who is Cheng Ge?

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.319
Cheng Ge is rewarded
with sea cucumber soup

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:33.159
for meritorious service.

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:42.879
Thank you.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.800
Look at the new waiting maid.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.879
How favored she is!

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:46.520
Indeed.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.680
Why does she get such favor?

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.080
Who knows?

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:01.919
(Still seeking chances.)

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.319
(Something's off.)

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:04.960
(The Emperor is a puppet.)

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.719
(Truth lies with another.)

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.520
She dares disobey me!

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:12.599
Could this jeopardize your plan?

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:15.280
It seems I underestimated Shi Yu.

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.000
If someone else
was behind Pingxiang rebellion

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.839
and the Pingxiang heirs

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:21.240
in the weaving house learn of it,

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:23.279
will they still help us kill Shi Yu?

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:25.160
Then we must act faster

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.399
and eliminate Shi Yu soon,

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.040
in case this becomes complicated.

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:30.680
Then we...

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:32.768
Isn't there an alternative method?

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:35.520
Make preparations.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.800
Understood.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.399
I'll do it myself.

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:48.032
Let me ask you.

00:05:49.088 --> 00:05:49.959
If the Prince Regent

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:51.839
truly massacred Pingxiang
under your watch,

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.319
with all court officials observing,

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.544
how could he deceive everyone?

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.079
The Prince Regent has arrived.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.399
See for yourself.

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:07.000
Your Majesty.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.720
Lord Father, why are you here?

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:12.240
I was about to see you.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.000
No need for formalities.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.768
I know about your stay
with the Empress last night.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.759
This marks a fresh start.

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:20.759
You've done exceptionally well.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.488
Your teachings

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.920
are etched in my heart.

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:26.199
What's delivered today

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:28.079
are medicinal tributes
from foreign envoys.

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:29.120
May Your Majesty

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:30.439
preserve your health.

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:31.680
Thank you.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.624
The Emperor prioritizes state affairs,

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:35.839
continuing his lineage

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.120
and securing the empire.

00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:39.160
The Prince Regent has great foresight.

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:40.279
Unity of wise ruler

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:41.839
and loyal officials

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:44.000
brings prosperity to the realm.

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:01.240
(The imperial seal)

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:02.680
(isn't with Shi Yu?)

00:07:28.519 --> 00:07:29.360
Please take care.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.040
I shall take my leave now.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.240
Good.

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:36.879
Excellent!

00:07:58.759 --> 00:08:00.224
(If Prince Regent holds historians,)

00:08:00.384 --> 00:08:02.439
(wouldn't history be his to rewrite?)

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.160
Don't move.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.680
I ask, you answer.

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:11.600
Yes, yes.

00:08:12.199 --> 00:08:13.839
Is the Pingxiang rebellion documented?

00:08:14.199 --> 00:08:15.600
It's Prince Regent's achievement.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.000
It must be documented.

00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:17.920
Where to verify?

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.279
Well...

00:08:20.079 --> 00:08:20.959
Think carefully.

00:08:21.319 --> 00:08:22.439
If even one word is a lie,

00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:24.240
this dagger won't show mercy.

00:08:25.879 --> 00:08:26.360
I'll talk.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.424
I'll speak.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:33.720
Time?

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:34.840
Your Majesty,

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.840
it's already Hai hour.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:36.768
Your Majesty,

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:38.000
you should rest now.

00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:39.616
Why isn't she back yet?

00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:41.960
Who?

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:48.759
Y-Your Majesty,

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:49.799
where are you going?

00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:50.759
Your Majesty!

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.559
(Never imagined a mere Archives Room)

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.840
(would have such heavy security.)

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:10.840
(The Prince Regent)

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.320
(has truly hidden)

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.559
(many shameful secrets here.)

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.000
Changing guards!

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:42.399
Your Majesty.

00:09:44.559 --> 00:09:45.376
Where's Cheng Ge?

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:46.976
Your Majesty,

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.600
I haven't seen her for some time.
