Kaifu.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.820
Stop the music.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.450
It's fine, no worries.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.540
Let me introduce someone.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.980
This is one of my good buddies.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:27.860
Kaifu.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:28.730
Come on, Kaifu.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.610
Have a seat.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.290
Sit down.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.220
I'm honored to have you here.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:41.700
What would you like to drink?

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:42.610
Let me introduce you.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.180
This is Mr. Li.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.580
Someone broke Liu Mingyi's leg

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.020
last night at the market.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.580
He's a merchant.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.020
Really?

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.070
Why didn't I hear about it?

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.660
Who did it? Step forward.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.100
Shuquan.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.640
I sent someone to do it.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.700
How many times have I told you?

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.140
We live under the rule of law now.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.620
Stop using those old street tactics.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.020
You're acting like thugs.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.420
Sorry, Shuquan.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.260
Why hit him anyway?

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.420
He refused to negotiate with us.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.780
In that case,

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.260
Kaifu is here.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.420
Kaifu.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:41.820
Let's have a talk.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.260
There's nothing to talk about.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.140
Huang Shuquan.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.800
Did you forget how I got you locked up

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.320
six years ago?

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:04.820
No, I didn't.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.600
You haven't changed at all.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.100
You did this?

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.660
You guys keep singing.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.600
I'm taking him with me.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.940
Come here.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.260
Make way!

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.300
Let's go home.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:21.740
Hong.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.540
Making such a big scene?

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.140
Just leaving like that?

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.980
Move aside.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.000
I told you to move aside.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.180
Move aside!

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.100
Don't move!

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.460
What are you doing?

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.700
Playing gangster now?

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.180
Take everyone away.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:11.900
- Go.
- Move.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.540
- Go.
- Move!

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:46.940
(Chencang Detention Center)

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:53.900
Why are you here?

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.180
Where's Qin Hong?

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.020
She doesn't want to see you.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.900
You shouldn't have done this.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.000
Why didn't you call the police?

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.460
You could've at least called me.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:08.860
You don't know the full story.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.780
Huang Shuquan

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.260
bullied a merchant.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:13.980
They broke his leg.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.220
I lost my temper, too.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.100
Lost your temper?

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:19.900
Are you a gangster?

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.020
If Hong hadn't called me,

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.620
you'd be locked up with them.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.140
Hong is brave and smart

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.540
as ever.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.540
You can never cross a woman.

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:36.660
How's Huang Shuquan?

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.340
His lackey wouldn't talk,

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.140
insisting no one told him to do it.

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.100
Huang Shuquan also denied it.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.340
We had to let him go after a few days.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.540
He's pretty sly.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.540
It'll be hard to catch him next time.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:54.380
Be careful.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.020
That's my problem.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:58.740
You should figure out

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:00.160
how to make things right with Hong.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:02.380
It's fine.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.500
It's nothing serious.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:18.980
(Tian Cai)

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:28.900
Hong?

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:30.980
Hong?

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:44.700
Kaifu.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.020
Second floor.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:55.500
Ms. Qin.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.020
Ms. Qin?

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.140
Hong.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.300
Hong?

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.540
I didn't bring my keys, Hong.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:10.740
I didn't bring my keys.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.780
I passed by a cake shop just now.

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.620
They had cakes fresh out of the oven.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.860
They said it tastes amazing,

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:31.840
so I bought you a piece.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:38.380
Where are you going?

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.020
Take a look.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:40.900
This is your stuff.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.540
Wait, where am I going?

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:44.900
Don't act clueless with me.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.020
Go wherever you want.

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.260
Let's break up.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:52.940
What are you doing?

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.180
What are you doing, Zhao Kaifu?

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:02.780
I won't do this again.

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.180
- Don't be mad.
- I'm not mad.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.520
Why would I be mad?

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.500
I just want to break up.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.780
It's over between us.

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:09.660
Got it?

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.900
Is this really necessary?

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.140
You think it isn't?

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.260
When you went there,
did you even think about me?

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.420
What if something

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:17.260
had happened to you?

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.480
Did that ever cross your mind?

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.460
Did you even think about that?

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:29.900
It's not necessary?

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.260
I promise you.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.140
I won't do that again.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.060
How are you going to prove that?

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:44.260
I know you too well.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.500
If the same thing happens again,

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.420
you'll still go.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:47.780
That's so you, Zhao Kaifu.

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.300
Back in the day, I would've gone.

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:55.900
But not anymore.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.540
Because I have you now.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.180
You mean a lot to me.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:03.310
When you went there,

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.420
didn't you ever think
about how much I mean to you?

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.020
Did you just forget me
when you decided to go?

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.140
This time, I was really scared.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.340
These days in detention,

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.600
the more I thought about it,
the more frightened I felt.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:19.850
I was afraid

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.900
that if something happened to me,

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.260
I'd never get to see you again.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:30.260
Qin Hong,

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:37.780
I swear to you.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.180
I will never do anything
that would make Qin Hong

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.500
live like a widow.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:49.780
Let's get married.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.180
Will you marry me?

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:09.780
You don't want to?

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:23.380
Of course not.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.120
Kaifu.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.180
How can you like someone like me?

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.060
Honestly,

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.420
I've never had hope

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:45.060
for marriage

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.260
or who I'd spend my life with.

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.260
Besides, I feel

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:52.860
like marriage

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.660
is far away from me.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:56.740
Maybe

00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.500
it's because of my parents.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.340
So,

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.540
I never once thought

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:07.600
about marrying anyone.

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:20.140
But I met you.

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.420
You changed that.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.940
After meeting you, I realized

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.140
being with you makes me feel so secure.

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.060
Sometimes, I even think

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.540
I could just spend my days

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:44.620
with you like this.

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:46.540
Sometimes,

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.780
I even start to imagine

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:50.420
that I can just

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.620
spend my whole life with you.

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.300
Maybe that wouldn't be so bad.

00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:59.540
Do you know

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.020
how it feels

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.380
when suddenly there's hope?

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.740
But when you do things like this,

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.620
it makes me realize all at once

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:11.900
that you could suddenly die.

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:18.900
That terrifies me.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:19.780
Do you understand?

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.060
I do.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:23.900
I do.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:30.300
I didn't expect

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.260
you to think about us

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.900
so deeply.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.660
I'm really sorry.

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.020
I'm sorry.

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.860
I hope you'll give me a chance.

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.540
I won't let you live

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.740
in fear and worry.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:58.780
Okay?

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.020
Marry me.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:10.900
Who are you kneeling to?

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.180
Who proposes with both knees
on the ground?

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:16.660
Is this okay?

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:17.540
Marry me.

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:20.380
Please, marry me.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:31.980
Try it on.

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:35.180
You're being way too pushy.

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:38.540
You've prepared a wedding suit for me?

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.020
Are you crazy?

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.220
Try it on.

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.420
It's for a formal meeting.

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:45.780
A formal meeting?

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.540
I've asked around recently.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.260
The property developer agreed to meet

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.780
with the head
of our demolition committee.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.020
If you're going to meet him,
you have to dress decently.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:57.260
Right?

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:00.740
As expected of Hong.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.780
What could I do without you?

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.260
Let's get married asap,

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.780
lest someone takes you away.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:09.260
I'll think about it.

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:12.380
Oh, right.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.060
What if they demolish this area?

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.020
So what?

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:16.060
We can go to Pingtan.

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:17.020
Where?

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:17.900
Pingtan.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:19.420
Pingtan?

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:21.380
Didn't you always say

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:22.540
you wanted to go to Pingtan?

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.940
You said the winter there is warmer.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.020
Then let's go and see

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.360
if it's really always like spring.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:31.500
While you're there,

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.340
you can open another Tian Cai.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.300
I'll work for you.

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:37.140
Alright.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:38.460
- Is that okay?
- Okay.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.140
Hong.

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:57.340
The talk's done.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:59.820
I've told them all our requests.

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:01.380
Things don't look bad.

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:03.420
That's great news.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:04.460
Hurry back.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.620
I'm making dumplings for you.

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:06.600
Wait for me to get home.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:07.800
I've got something to tell you.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.500
Alright, stop talking so much.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:10.340
Bye-bye.

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:19.660
Good afternoon, sir.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.060
Is there anything you'd like to see?

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:22.400
I'd like to buy a ring.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:23.780
Sure, please come with me.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.060
Take a look at these.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.100
Which one best represents
everlasting love?

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.060
Everlasting love...

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.220
How about this one?

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:44.940
This one looks good.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.100
I'll have this.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:47.940
Alright.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:54.780
Hong,

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:56.740
please marry me.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.860
Marry me, Hong.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:25.700
Marry me.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.300
Why are you only back now?

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:05.340
Go wash your hands.

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:39.820
(Tian Cai)

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.740
This was found

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:28.940
at the scene.

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:32.460
Kaifu bought it for you.

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:02.140
Yes, I'll marry him.

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:24.900
He even bought the wrong size.

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.140
What's going on?

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.620
What happened?

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:47.420
Can we still save him, Wang?

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:51.940
Try again, please.

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:55.660
Wang, what happened?

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:52.300
Chief Liu.

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.740
I don't get it.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.640
That driver's name is Zhao Chen, right?

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.910
He hit Zhao Kaifu with his car.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:03.980
How's that connected to me?

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.220
Zhao Chen and Zhao Kaifu
aren't even related.

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:08.460
Why would Zhao Chen
want to kill Zhao Kaifu?

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:09.660
Then you should ask Zhao Chen.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:10.630
Why ask me?

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:11.470
How would I know?

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:12.460
You definitely know.

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.960
Zhao Chen delivers drinks
to your Rose City, right?

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:17.810
Yeah.

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:19.300
You held a grudge against Zhao Kaifu

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.340
because of the demolition, right?

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:23.700
Chief Liu, that's not true.

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.940
I'd always respected Kaifu.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.520
He said he didn't want to talk about it,

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:29.600
so I let it go.

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:30.620
We've been detained once

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.660
for that matter.

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:34.420
What grudge can I have?

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:35.900
Plus, my guy's been taken in.

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:37.660
Why think I'm the one who killed him?

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:38.860
Doesn't that sound far-fetched?

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:41.140
Huang Shuquan,

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.140
still pretending here, huh?

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:45.980
Answer me.

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.900
You gave Zhao Chen 300,000.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:49.900
How do you explain that?

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.420
I'll be straight with you.

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:54.900
Zhao Chen has confessed to everything.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.660
You won't get away from this.

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:15.100
Honestly,

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:17.460
you're so perceptive.

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:19.580
Nothing ever gets past you.

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:25.140
Two months ago,

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.420
Zhao Chen came to me.

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.140
He said he had a batch of cheap liquor.

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.140
Normally, I buy it at 4 per bottle.

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.260
He told me he'd sell it
for half the price,

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.180
so I bought 300,000 yuan worth from him.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:40.620
I admit it.

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:41.980
I was being greedy.

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:43.820
I should've realized sooner.

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:44.700
There had to be

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:46.300
something shady with cheap goods.

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.040
Wishful thinking.

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:47.960
Such wishful thinking.

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:48.900
Huang Shuqian.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:49.740
Chief Liu.

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:50.710
Still acting, huh?

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:51.620
You're still acting?

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:52.660
I'm admitting my mistake.

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:53.590
Nice performance.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.900
Punish me however you want.

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:56.500
Fine me as much as I deserve.

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:57.460
I'll accept it.

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.140
But as far as I know,

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:02.660
this is

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:04.380
beyond the CIU's jurisdiction.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:17.500
Come in.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:24.200
Chief Liu, it's been verified.

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:27.060
The money in Zhao Chen's account
is indeed payment for goods.

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:16.580
Why did you release him?

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:20.140
He's a murderer.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:23.860
Calm down first.

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:25.240
Let me explain.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.480
I don't want your explanation.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:27.340
Arrest him.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:29.700
Hong,

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:32.740
sorry for your loss.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.140
Get lost.

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:49.660
Wang.

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:55.980
You told me you were sure about this.

00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:59.180
Sorry. Give me more time.

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:00.700
Don't say that to me.

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:05.620
Say that to Kaifu.

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:33.660
Uncle Liu.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:34.740
Danshun.

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:39.860
You're moving out, too?

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:43.980
After Kaifu's death,

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:45.900
everyone's spirits just fell apart.

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.140
Most folks

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:48.180
have signed the papers.

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:49.580
If I stay,

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.140
I'll just keep getting pushed around
by Huang Shuquan.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:54.860
Forget it. I'm done fighting.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.140
Hong.

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:47.040
Uncle Liu said you haven't opened
the store for half a month.

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:49.380
How about this?

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:50.900
I'll help you look after the store.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:58.420
Go home.

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:02.460
I won't reopen this store.

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:14.660
Kaifu would want you to live well.

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:15.860
Don't mention him again.

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:18.140
It's all in the past.

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:22.140
You should go now.

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.340
Let's pretend we never met.

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:41.740
(Tian Cai)

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:21.420
Hello?

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:24.460
Shuquan.

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:56.580
Hong.

00:31:58.420 --> 00:31:59.260
Please, have a seat.

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:08.920
Are you sure about this?

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.060
Yes.

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:19.380
You're not gonna ask
for ten million again, right?

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:22.220
Definitely not.

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:24.380
But, Shuquan,

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:25.900
the price you offer me

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:27.500
should be a bit higher than others,

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:28.500
right?

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:30.740
Listen to yourself.

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:32.380
With the friendship we've got,

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:33.620
even if you didn't say it,

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:35.700
I'd still make sure
you get the best offer.

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:37.460
With the same area,

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:39.660
someone else got 2.2 million.

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.380
I'll give you 2.6 million.

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:52.300
Here's 600,000.

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:53.900
Consider it a deposit.

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.700
Once we sign the contract,

00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:58.220
I'll pay the rest in full.

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:02.660
Alright.

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:06.140
But once you agree, no backing out.

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:07.940
Do I look like someone who backs out?

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:23.660
There was just

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.060
a misunderstanding between us before.

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:27.380
I've been wanting to find a chance

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:29.140
to explain it to you.

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:31.180
But it seems I don't need to now.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:32.860
You've thought it through.

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:34.500
Of course not.

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:36.860
It's such a simple matter.

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:38.700
What's there to be confused about?

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:42.660
Back then,

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:44.980
someone always came

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:46.420
to cause trouble in my store.

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:48.860
It was always Kaifu

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:50.980
who helped me sort things out.

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:53.980
Kaifu

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:55.180
was a good man

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:56.860
and treated me well, too.

00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:58.740
So, I stuck with him.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:01.580
But now,

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:04.620
Kaifu's gone.

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.820
Tell me. What should I do?

00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:12.500
Hong,

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:14.980
from now on,

00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:17.900
whatever you need,

00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:20.140
just come straight to me.

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:24.740
I'm not any worse than Kaifu.

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:28.420
I can tell.

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:42.420
Now,

00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:43.900
let me introduce myself.

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:45.900
My name is Qin Hong.

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:49.260
Okay.

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:15.740
(Tian Cai)

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:27.340
Why not go in and take a look?

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:30.100
It's worth 2.6 million.

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:34.260
Sure.

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:38.060
Last time, you kicked me out.

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:40.980
This time, I'm checking every detail.

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:46.420
You go back first.

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:11.140
Figure out

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:12.900
another price.

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:14.940
I want

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:16.900
your store

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:18.900
and you.

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.300
Go wait for me on the sofa.

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:45.940
Shuquan's not going
to Rose City tonight?

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:47.120
Guess where he went instead.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.020
How would I know?

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:49.220
Let me give you a hint.

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.460
Someone he's been longing for.

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:52.500
The boss lady from Tian Cai?

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.500
I don't even know
if I should go see him tonight.

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:38.060
Do you really think I believe you?

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:41.940
I use drugs all the time.

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:43.700
This is nothing to me.

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:01.820
Let me go!

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:13.340
When you hit me on the head,

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:14.620
I wanted to mess with you.

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:16.900
Now, you walk right up to me.

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:17.740
Come on.

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:19.420
Let me go!

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:23.260
Danshun!

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:24.580
Leave now.

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:27.180
If anyone asks,

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.740
you were never here today.

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:31.380
You don't know anything.

00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:32.460
Got it?

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:33.420
What about you?

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:38.900
I can turn myself in.

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:40.140
I'll say I did it.

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:41.180
Turn yourself in?

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:46.700
All his people know he came to see me.

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:47.900
There's no way I can get away.

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:49.180
You have to run.

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:54.180
So,

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:57.420
you kept me from coming to you.

00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:01.860
You had planned to kill him all along.

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:06.580
I can't drag you into this.

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:08.740
I'm already in it, Hong.

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:10.780
Let's go together.

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:16.260
Danshun.

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:18.100
Listen to me.

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:20.900
I just killed someone.

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:23.460
I'm a murderer now.

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:27.980
This isn't something to joke about.

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:29.060
Hong.

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:35.940
You've protected me since I was a kid.

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:40.540
Now, it's my turn to protect you.

00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:01.260
(Tian Cai)

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:04.420
(Police)

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:09.420
Make way, please!

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:10.380
Move aside!

00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:12.720
Stop looking and leave.

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:14.370
Go home.

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:33.180
Chief Liu.
