=Episode 2=

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.439
Sister-in-law.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.079
Where are you trying to sneak off to?

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:06.000
Sister-in-law?

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.200
Don't move.

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:14.680
My brother's room is right next door.

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:16.519
Do you want me to call him out for you?

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.560
(Are people here truly this shameless?)

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.879
Sister-in-law.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.799
It's been days.

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:25.159
Did you miss me?

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.079
I'm your sister-in-law.

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:29.000
So what?

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.719
Fu Yunyun,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.239
you're mine.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.359
When I come back,

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:44.760
I'll tell everyone about us.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.680
We'll never be apart again.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.599
All right.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.840
Two years will pass quickly.

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:52.000
Wait for me to return.

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:04.799
Come here.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.800
- Second Young Master.
- Second Young Master.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.360
You're looking better by the day, sir.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:22.199
Yansheng.

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.660
Grandmother.

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:23.240
Mother.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.439
My precious son, you're finally home!

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:26.599
It's been two years.

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.199
I've missed you so much!

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:31.479
My little darling.

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:32.599
Come, sit down quickly.

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:33.199
Sit down.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.080
Shiqi.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.560
Yansheng.

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:37.240
Yunyun.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.240
From now on,

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:42.039
you can't call her Yunyun anymore.

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.319
She's already married to your brother.

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:46.599
You should call her Sister-in-law.

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:07.199
I...

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.599
I'm going to the bathroom.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.879
He's home now.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.360
Yansheng will be fine.

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.000
Didn't you say you'd wait for me?

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:28.280
What happened?

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.759
Why did you suddenly marry my brother?

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.439
Why?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.719
Why?

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:35.599
Gu Yansheng.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.759
I've never liked you.

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:43.360
The one I want to marry
is the head of the Gu family.

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:45.120
You're not worthy.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.319
(Could Fu Yunyun
really have abandoned him so coldly?)

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.120
Who's there?

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.800
Scared already?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.959
Psycho.

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:39.759
(What does "psycho" mean?)

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:40.800
What are you doing here?

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:46.720
Just taking a walk.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.040
Fortunately, we rescued her in time.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.240
The old lady's condition has stabilized.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.000
However,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.240
the toxin has affected her brain.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.800
It's likely

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.120
she'll remain unconscious for a while.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.040
How long will that be?

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.199
A few days at least,

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:15.399
maybe a few months.

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:17.000
It depends on her physical condition.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.600
Once she wakes up,
she should recover fully.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.959
What caused it?

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:24.120
She probably took
a neurotoxic substance by mistake.

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:25.720
Thank you, doctor.

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:26.839
You're welcome.

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:32.639
I've examined that pill.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.390
There was indeed
something wrong with it.

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:36.720
I misunderstood you.

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:39.240
That's great.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.279
I'm just glad Grandmother's safe.

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:47.240
What's this?

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:48.480
A handkerchief.

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:51.240
You never used
this sort of thing before.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.439
Just use it.

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:55.240
Shiqi.

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:57.920
In life, cry when you want to cry,
laugh when you want to laugh.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.720
Don't restrain yourself.

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:01.839
Yunyun,

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.480
you seem different from before.

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:11.160
Well,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.639
if that's all,

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:13.639
I'll take Shiqi back first.

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:14.399
Stop.

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:19.959
Tonight,

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.279
I'll come to you.

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:28.480
Let's go.

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:51.160
How long do I have to stay here?

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:52.879
Could it be

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.680
that I can never go back?

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:03.120
Do you need something?

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.079
What's the meaning of this?

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.319
We're husband and wife.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.319
Isn't it natural for me
to come to your room?

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.120
You...

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.639
Don't you dare.

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:16.720
We're not truly husband and wife.

00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:19.160
And as far as I know,

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.399
you've never stepped foot
in this room before.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.040
Fu Yunyun.

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:37.959
You've never
treated me like this before.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.519
You've been acting strange lately.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.959
Almost like you've become
a different person.

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:54.199
You suspected me
of poisoning the old madam,

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:56.639
did you still expect me
to treat you nicely?

00:07:58.519 --> 00:07:59.959
So that's the reason?

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.160
Of course.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.079
You're my husband,

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.160
yet you don't trust me.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.759
Your actions

00:08:06.759 --> 00:08:08.319
are truly disappointing.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.720
Very well then.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.639
I haven't treated you
well enough before.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.040
So tonight,

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.519
let me make it up to you properly.

00:08:50.919 --> 00:08:51.919
How about

00:08:53.919 --> 00:08:56.320
you take a shower first?

00:09:04.679 --> 00:09:05.559
All right.

00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:16.759
Darn it.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.799
He's testing me.

00:09:19.639 --> 00:09:20.879
Could it be...

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:24.200
he's realised I'm not the real Fu Yunyun?

00:09:26.639 --> 00:09:27.559
Forget it.

00:09:28.639 --> 00:09:29.919
Of the thirty-six stratagems,

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.720
retreat is the best one.

00:09:38.639 --> 00:09:39.639
Who let you in?

00:09:39.919 --> 00:09:40.639
Get out.
