=Episode 18=

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:04.560
What's wrong?

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:07.319
Nothing.

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:10.000
Chenyu, we've arrived.

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:17.400
What's wrong with your eyes?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.480
My vision's a little blurry.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.879
The doctor said I'll lose my sight soon.

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:27.760
Poisoning?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.640
Yes.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.159
According to the lab report,

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.200
you've been exposed to
a large amount of toxins over time.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.599
The exposure period exceeds six months.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.519
The most recent instance
was within the past three days.

00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:38.480
(Three days?)

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.920
(Bai Lanxing was already caught.)

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.599
(Then who's been poisoning me?)

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:43.319
Here, look.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.359
The darker area is where
the damage is occurring.

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.359
The toxin has started damaging
your optic nerves.

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:51.879
Your vision
will continue to deteriorate.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.719
It may not take long before...

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:55.840
You mean...

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:57.920
I'll go blind?

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.719
You need to prepare yourself mentally.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.439
How could this happen, Chenyu?

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:04.879
What did the doctor say?

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:05.760
Can it be cured?

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.920
Shiqi.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.159
You must keep this secret for me.

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.439
Don't tell anyone.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.800
Why?

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.800
There's a lot going on at the company.

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:15.680
If anyone else finds out,

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.680
the board will force me to step down.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.599
Lead the way for me.

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.080
Treat me like a normal person.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.120
Got it, Chenyu.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.599
Then I'll hold your arm.

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:24.400
No need.

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:26.199
Walk ahead of me.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.080
Don't let it show.

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:33.319
Mr. Gu.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.759
- Mr. Gu.
- Hello.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.879
Hello?

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:47.599
Third Uncle?

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.400
Gu Chenyu.

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.199
Who gave you permission
to return the hotel to Fu Yunyun?

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:12.960
I'll personally cover all the losses

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:14.879
the company suffers.

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.479
That one Jiangxing Hotel

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:18.719
is enough to drain half your fortune.

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:20.960
You've completely
lost your mind over love.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.759
Do you remember how hard we worked

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:24.400
to get Jiangxing Hotel
in the first place?

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:26.000
And now you just give it away?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.800
Third Uncle.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.680
It's what we owe the Fu family.

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.159
"I, Fu Zhengkang,

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:39.520
would rather die
than hand Jiangxing over to you."

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:42.159
Uncle Fu.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.919
Uncle Fu...

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:52.120
Third Uncle.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.199
Third Uncle.

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:07.599
Maybe let it go.

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:09.719
The board has its eyes on that hotel.

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.240
Don't you want to be
the future head of the Gu family?

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:16.560
Gu Yansheng will return
from overseas soon.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.920
And he'll have Bai Lanxing by his side.

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:21.000
If you can't secure Jiangxing

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.399
and hold your position,

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.279
you'll be at a disadvantage
in the Gu family later.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.000
If he's got the ability, let him try.

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.160
You're still too young.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.360
Chenyu.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.319
You go first.

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:42.759
I'll talk to Fu Zhengkang myself.

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:44.160
Third Uncle.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.740
(Third Uncle
Third Uncle, where did you go?)

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.720
Someone jumped!

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.560
Isn't that Mr. Fu?

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.439
Dad!

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:16.959
Dad, look at me!

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.199
Someone help me!

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.480
Please, someone help me!

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.199
No photos.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.199
Everyone, please stop taking photos.

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:39.360
I asked you many times after that.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.120
You said you only talked
with Uncle Fu for a moment and left.

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:45.600
But if we hadn't done anything wrong,

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.800
why did you have someone
hack the hotel's surveillance?

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.480
The video Yunyun received...

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:52.600
You sent it to her, didn't you?

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.279
What really happened back then?

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.360
What actually happened that year?

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.519
Whatever happened,

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.600
I did it all for your own good.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.480
Third Uncle.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.199
Ever since my parents passed away,

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.920
you've been the one guiding me,

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:15.519
supporting and raising me.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.600
I've long regarded you as family.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.879
So even though I had doubts,

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:22.759
I never dared to
look deeper over the past year.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.600
But today,

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.399
I need a clear answer from you.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.160
So Uncle Fu's death that year...

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.360
Was it really because of you?

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.600
I promised your mother back then

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.160
that I'd make you
the head of the Gu family.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.000
So the things you couldn't do,

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.680
I did for you.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.319
The ruthlessness you lacked,

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.160
I carried out instead.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.839
And after that,

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:03.720
didn't you smoothly
acquire Jiangxing Hotel?

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:05.000
Chenyu,

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.680
you're still too young.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.279
Too soft-hearted.

00:07:09.519 --> 00:07:11.360
When you reach my age,

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.399
you'll understand.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.879
I've already fulfilled
Fu Yunyun's last wish.

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:40.680
So why can't I return?

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:47.000
Miss.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.120
Mr. Gu sent over
the hotel transfer contract.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.199
(Jiangxing Hotel Transfer Contract)

00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:55.079
That's wonderful.

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:57.560
Jiangxing is finally back in your hands.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.000
Wait, this...

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.680
You recognise it?

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:09.959
It's the Fu family heirloom.

00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:11.160
A jade pendant

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.240
symbolizing each generation's family head.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.959
Mr. Fu always wore it.

00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:17.160
Later, didn't you take it
with you to the Gu residence?

00:08:18.279 --> 00:08:21.920
The piece on the back of this token
looks very similar to that one.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.959
I have a photo of it here.
Let me show you.

00:08:27.279 --> 00:08:28.079
Alright.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.399
Here it is.

00:08:35.879 --> 00:08:36.720
(That's right.)

00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:38.919
(There are two halves
of the jade pendant.)

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.360
(If I piece them together,
I can go back.)

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.360
Strange.

00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:02.559
Where did Fu Yunyun
put the other half of the jade pendant?

00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:13.399
What's all this stuff?

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.600
The room isn't that big.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.600
Where could it be?

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.480
Who's there?

00:09:33.159 --> 00:09:34.159
Shiqi?

00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:37.840
What are you doing here?

00:09:42.759 --> 00:09:45.200
Gu Chenyu, what's wrong with your eyes?

00:09:48.759 --> 00:09:49.919
Why did you come back?

00:09:49.919 --> 00:09:51.879
I came to look for something.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:53.519
You still haven't answered me.

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:54.679
What's wrong with your eyes?

00:09:56.399 --> 00:09:57.039
It's nothing.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.000
I just saw things blurry for a moment.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.320
Do you think I'm a child?

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.679
We're standing this close now.

00:10:04.919 --> 00:10:05.759
Fu Yunyun.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.480
We're already divorced.

00:10:10.279 --> 00:10:12.559
Did you come back
just to check on your ex-husband?

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:18.320
You're right.

00:10:19.279 --> 00:10:22.360
Whether you live or die
has nothing to do with me.

00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:24.200
I shouldn't have cared.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:37.799
Yunyun.

00:10:40.159 --> 00:10:40.720
Shiqi.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:41.639
Shiqi.

00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:43.559
What's wrong with Gu Chenyu's eyes?

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:44.919
You...

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.600
You already know?

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.159
He can't see clearly, can he?

00:10:49.159 --> 00:10:50.360
When did it start?

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.080
He was poisoned,
damaging his optic nerves.

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:54.360
It's been several days now.

00:10:54.799 --> 00:10:56.879
The doctor said he might go blind.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.799
Yunyun, I've been wanting to tell you.

00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:02.080
But my brother wouldn't let me.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.279
He even kept it from Yansheng.

00:11:04.279 --> 00:11:07.360
His eyesight has been
worsening rapidly these days.

00:11:07.559 --> 00:11:09.480
But he still pretends to be fine
and goes to work every day.

00:11:09.799 --> 00:11:11.159
He doesn't say it out loud,

00:11:11.559 --> 00:11:13.360
but I know he's really in pain.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.799
Yunyun, he needs you.

00:11:15.799 --> 00:11:16.879
Can't you come back to help him?

00:11:16.879 --> 00:11:17.480
Shiqi.

00:11:21.759 --> 00:11:22.879
I can't help him.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.120
I'm sorry.

00:11:27.679 --> 00:11:28.480
Yunyun...

00:11:52.759 --> 00:11:54.600
Gu Chenyu, can you lend it to me?

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.360
It's yours.

00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:57.960
Twenty million.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:11:59.799
You're just giving it to me?

00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:02.600
About what happened with Grandma,
I misunderstood you before.

00:12:02.879 --> 00:12:03.960
Take this as an apology.

00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:15.360
I can't take part in your past anymore.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:16.799
But from now on,

00:12:16.799 --> 00:12:18.159
everything you do,

00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:20.360
every choice you want to make,

00:12:21.399 --> 00:12:22.759
I'll stand by you.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.399
No.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.360
Nangong Yu, get a grip.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.000
Gu Chenyu is the one
who caused Fu Yunyun's father's death.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.240
You shouldn't be involved
with him anymore.

00:12:39.559 --> 00:12:42.480
He once took a knife for me.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.799
He might have had his own reasons.

00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:49.480
Maybe I should ask him myself.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.159
It's for you.
