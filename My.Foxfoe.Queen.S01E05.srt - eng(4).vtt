00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.999
It's getting cold.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.519
This is a warming medicinal broth.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.630
Your Lordship, please drink it.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.470
Your Highness,
you needn't treat me this way.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.110
I don't deserve it.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.319
Why wouldn't you?

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.390
We're all family.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.959
But I'm a demon.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.399
What's wrong with being a demon?

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.999
If one harbors kindness,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.959
even a demon can ascend to immortality.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.519
If one bears malice,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.590
a human can also fall into darkness.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.559
Don't mind what others think of you.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.590
Just be yourself.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.110
You're right, Your Highness.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.399
Drink it while it's hot.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.990
I made it myself.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.990
What's going on?

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.119
Your Lordship! An explosion
broke out in the city market.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.910
Many civilians were killed and injured.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.559
Gather the men at once.
Come with me to rescue them.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.990
Yes.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.719
Slow down. Go save the people.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.310
Yes!

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.559
Your Lordship.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.390
Please save me.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.510
Xiling Xuan, go to hell!

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.230
You did all this today, didn't you?

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.599
Why did you do it?

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.719
If I didn't,
how else could I draw you out?

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.119
You wretch!

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.119
You deceived my feelings,

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.559
and slaughtered my entire snake clan!

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.319
I'll kill you

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.759
and avenge them!

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.519
Take me to see your family.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.799
Your clan.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.199
I want to propose marriage to them.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.550
Mm.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.119
(It's her.)

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.590
Nonsense!

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.790
When did I ever have feelings for you?

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.999
Even if I did slaughter your clan,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.319
it was my duty.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.719
Hmph!

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.919
I actually believed
a human's lies back then.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.919
If you don't want me to kill her,

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.559
then come here
and let me kill you instead!

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.030
Fine.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.070
Then kill me.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.679
(It seems she doesn't know
Xiling Xuan can heal himself.)

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.439
(That way,
not only will she fail to kill him,)

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.590
(but Xiling Xuan
will end up killing her instead.)

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.159
Wait, don't come closer!

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.870
Don't kill me.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.519
I know you want revenge,

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.919
but you need to stay calm.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.120
You must know Xiling Xuan
is a demon who can self-heal.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.159
Ordinary methods can't kill him.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.959
They'll only bring disaster upon you.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.399
I advise you to leave now

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.630
and plan your revenge carefully later.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.959
You think
I'd still believe a human's lies?

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.599
You deceived me too.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.319
There's not
a single good human among you!

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.670
No!

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.999
Xiling Xuan.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.359
Did you truly never love me,
not even a little?

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.439
I've never even met you.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.919
(Coward who won't admit his deeds.)

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.630
(What a despicable man.)

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.830
Go to hell!

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.310
(Xiling Xuan.)

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.470
(This is all your doing.)

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.470
(Your sins are great.)

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.510
Ten Directions Heavenly Venerates.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.710
All beings are like grains of sand.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.630
Transform the Ten Directions Realm.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.270
Deliver salvation to the world.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.999
Ten Directions Heavenly Venerates.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.510
All beings are like grains of sand.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.790
Transform the Ten Directions Realm.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.990
Deliver salvation to the world.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.839
Yaya.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.399
Who taught you this funeral chant?

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.990
My mother.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.950
You...

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.710
This funeral chant of yours...

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.510
Who taught it to you?

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.990
My Imperial Brother.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.990
Your Imperial Brother?

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.559
(It seems I was overthinking.)

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.910
(How could Xiling Xuan possibly be him?)

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.830
Your Highness.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.990
Snake venom...

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.390
Forgive me, Your Highness.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.759
Save the people quickly.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.199
No citizen must die tragically!

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.670
Yes!

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.119
Your Majesty!

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.959
Your Majesty!

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.839
Please save us! My mother is still inside!

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.959
Don't worry.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.039
I'll make sure they're rescued.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.510
How are you feeling?

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.190
Cold.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.479
Cold.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.919
Cold...

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.959
The weather's turning cold.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.439
This is a warming medicinal broth.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.590
Your Lordship, please drink it.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.479
So cold.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.119
So cold.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.239
Come.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.710
Let's go back first.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.879
Stand up, quickly!

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.159
I'll definitely save them.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.039
I'll bring them out safely.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.350
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.839
So cold.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.790
Drink the medicine,
and you'll feel better.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.359
How are you feeling?

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.870
Any better?

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.519
Your Highness...

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.990
It's so hot.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.830
So hot.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.319
Your Highness, what are you doing?

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.959
It's so hot.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.030
Your Highness.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.919
Your Highness.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.990
Don't move.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.270
(Your Highness...)

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.830
(Why can't I move?)

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.430
Your Highness.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.430
Your Highness,
what's happening to you?

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.719
Your Highness.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.190
Don't speak.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.919
Do you want

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.710
everyone to hear us?

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.790
You really are a demon.
