00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.039
Why are you still here so late?

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.600
Don't worry.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.239
Let's go ask Chenyu
and get it clear now.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.840
The boss is urging us
to finish the presentation.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.400
Have you heard
about the Jiangxing Hotel incident?

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.840
It seems to be causing
quite a stir recently.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.640
What is the PR department
planning to do?

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.359
I'll tell you.

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:15.120
Mr. Gu

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.519
knows how to handle this matter.

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:17.319
What method?

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:18.640
I heard

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.400
that Mr. Gu put all the responsibility

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.239
on the head chef.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.640
Claiming he compromised quality
for personal gain.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.730
So he used inferior ingredients.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.640
Anyway, those were the old staff
from before the hotel was acquired.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.560
They were Fu family's people.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.239
Perfect scapegoats.

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:31.519
Also a chance to clean house.

00:01:31.519 --> 00:01:33.040
As expected of Mr. Gu.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.840
Two birds with one stone.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.920
And he gets off clean.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.879
Exactly.

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:36.760
I'm telling you,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.400
I heard

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.120
that this whole thing

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.959
was actually planned by Mr. Gu himself.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.599
No wonder.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.319
So this matter…

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.599
Fine.

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:00.359
Yunyun.

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:01.000
Gu Chenyu.

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.040
Immediately withdraw your PR draft.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.239
You don't need to handle
the Jiangxing Hotel incident anymore.

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.800
I will release a statement
clarifying everything within two days.

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:13.199
I will not allow you to slander
any Jiangxing Hotel employee.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.520
What PR draft?

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.970
I don't know what
you're talking about, Yunyun.

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.039
Yunyun.

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.000
Did you misunderstand Chenyu?

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.439
There are so many people in the company,

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:24.599
let's discuss this at home.

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.570
Whether it's a misunderstanding,
you know best in your heart.

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:27.560
Chenyu,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.919
this time you really went too far.

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:29.960
How could you treat
Jiangxing Hotel employees like this?

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.719
Gu Chenyu,

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.240
don't you have anything to say?

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.599
I didn't release the PR draft.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.080
Let's go.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.520
Uncle.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.639
Why did you make decisions
for me without permission?

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.199
I said I didn't agree to let
Jiangxing Hotel employees take the blame.

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:02.120
Sacrificing just one head chef.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.560
Since when have you become
so soft-hearted?

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.240
For the group and for you,

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.520
this is the best solution.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.439
Come.

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:12.800
Sit.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.199
I said no, that's final.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.840
Is it because of Fu Yunyun?

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:24.879
Because of my conscience.

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:26.400
Conscience?

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.120
Did you forget how her father died?

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:32.080
You haven't forgotten.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.800
Fu Yunyun hasn't forgotten either.

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:36.599
She was obviously
Gu Yansheng's girlfriend.

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.840
Why did she suddenly marry you?

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.280
From the beginning,

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.919
she had ulterior motives.

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.800
Back then, the old lady liked her,

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.000
and insisted you marry her.

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:49.759
But now,

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:52.400
the old lady is already incoherent.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.319
You should divorce her immediately.

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:56.960
Take full control of Jiangxing Hotel.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.800
No.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.919
What did you say?

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:04.520
I will not divorce her.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.560
The matter with her father was my fault.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.639
I should atone,

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.800
not continue to hurt her.

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.879
Gu Chenyu,

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:13.520
you're crazy.

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:15.560
Uncle.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.279
You've always taught me

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.240
to put the interests of the group first

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.720
before personal interests.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.000
To fight with all my might for
the position of head of the family,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.399
even if it means
using any means necessary.

00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:28.800
But this past year, I've been asking myself,

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.560
what is right

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.639
and what is wrong?

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.240
For the sake of profit,

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.639
now the Gu family is in disarray.

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:38.720
Grandma was poisoned,

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.560
and I've also gone
against my conscience.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.319
Is this really the right thing to do?

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.720
I don't want to continue like this.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.319
I will help Yunyun
protect Jiangxing Hotel,

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:55.720
and do what I believe is right.

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:57.920
Sorry, Uncle.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.800
Her father's death

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.000
will always be a thorn between you two.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.720
No matter what you do for her,

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:06.959
she will never truly love you.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.199
You will regret it sooner or later.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.360
You…

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:26.560
Madam,

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:30.120
everything is proceeding as you wished.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.160
Moreover, the doctor
who diagnosed the food poisoning

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.199
died unexpectedly at Jiangxing Hotel.

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:36.000
Brilliant.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.399
Now,

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:38.560
the public will think

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.279
that Gu Chenyu drove him to his death.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.959
If Fu Yunyun comes out now

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:50.519
and reveals that her father
was forced to die back then,

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:51.839
together with this,

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:55.199
Gu Chenyu

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.680
probably won't recover from this.

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.120
Madam is clever as always.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.199
But what about Wang Hao's daughter?

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:08.639
Of course,

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:11.519
we'll send her to reunite
with her father.

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:14.920
Reunion?

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:16.879
Understood.

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:20.199
Don't worry.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.000
Wang Hao is with us.

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:24.000
We'll have him record a clarification.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.920
The rest will be handled by the police.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.519
Jiangxing Hotel will surely
be proven innocent.

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:35.120
Oh no.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.000
Could someone be silenced?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.360
Wang Hao.

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:37.800
Wang Hao!

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.759
Go find Wang Huatao
and call the police for an ambulance.

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:41.319
Okay.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.800
Wang Hao!

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.079
What did you say?

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.079
Speak clearly.

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:09.639
Come out.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.879
How is my daughter?

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.560
I followed Mr. Bai's instructions.

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:18.319
You must save my daughter.

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:19.879
You've done well.

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:23.199
See?

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:25.279
Madam said

00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:27.600
you'll be reunited with her now.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.800
Good.

00:07:31.959 --> 00:07:32.759
What are you doing?

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:33.720
Let go of me!

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.040
Dare to kill someone on my territory?

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.120
I don't know anything.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.720
Doesn't matter.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.120
Anyway, it's already recorded.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.600
Gu Chenyu,

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.959
we've taken care of it here.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.120
Don't you have anything to say?

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.360
I didn't release the PR draft.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.279
Let's go.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.360
Yunyun.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.800
There must be a misunderstanding here.

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:34.799
Let's talk privately.

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:35.960
What else is there to talk about?

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.159
Yunyun.

00:08:37.399 --> 00:08:37.679
Let's go.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:39.279
Give me a chance to explain.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.919
I swear,

00:08:46.919 --> 00:08:48.919
the PR department's orders weren't mine.

00:08:49.559 --> 00:08:50.399
I absolutely would never

00:08:50.399 --> 00:08:52.360
let anyone from Jiangxing Hotel
take the blame.

00:08:52.879 --> 00:08:54.600
I can't trust
what you're saying right now.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.240
Fine.

00:08:56.879 --> 00:08:58.960
I will find out the truth
within two days.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.879
Have you contacted that doctor already?

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:06.960
Why are you asking?

00:09:08.799 --> 00:09:09.919
I've checked.

00:09:09.919 --> 00:09:11.200
He has a child

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.919
with severe congenital heart disease.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.200
This year is the last chance
for surgery.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.279
Originally, the child
was in the countryside,

00:09:18.279 --> 00:09:19.360
without money for surgery.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.360
But recently,

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.600
the case was secretly transferred
to a hospital under Gu Group,

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.080
and the surgery fees were paid.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.000
You mean to say

00:09:27.679 --> 00:09:29.159
that the girl is a hostage?

00:09:29.159 --> 00:09:29.799
Think about it.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.759
If his daughter is in my hands,

00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:33.960
would he dare admit to you
that I ordered him to do it?

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.039
Oh no.

00:09:40.039 --> 00:09:41.600
I locked him in Jiangxing Hotel.

00:09:41.919 --> 00:09:43.799
If someone wants him to die
in the hotel,

00:09:43.799 --> 00:09:45.490
Jiangxing Hotel will never
be able to clear its name.

00:09:45.559 --> 00:09:46.159
Don't panic.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.679
Since they planned this long ago,

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.720
then we will

00:09:55.039 --> 00:09:56.480
meet each move with a counter.
