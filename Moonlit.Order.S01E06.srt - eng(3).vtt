You should leave.

Avoid being seen,

00:04:24.262 --> 00:04:24.981
or invite rumors.

00:04:28.582 --> 00:04:29.462

00:04:30.662 --> 00:04:32.381
I could solve your problem,

00:04:33.142 --> 00:04:33.662
believe me?

00:04:40.782 --> 00:04:42.102

00:04:43.501 --> 00:04:43.981

00:04:51.022 --> 00:04:52.102
You could just tell me

00:04:53.142 --> 00:04:54.822
where these thorns truly lie.

00:04:55.501 --> 00:04:57.061
I'll clear the path for you.

00:04:58.662 --> 00:04:59.981
But if I told you

00:05:00.782 --> 00:05:02.301
this thorny path

00:05:02.621 --> 00:05:04.501
would cost your Xue family's lives,

00:05:05.981 --> 00:05:06.941
would you dare?

00:05:14.861 --> 00:05:15.702
Just a jest.

00:05:19.102 --> 00:05:19.941
Our Xue family

00:05:20.142 --> 00:05:20.861
is tough,

00:05:21.902 --> 00:05:22.861
no dead ends for us.

00:05:27.855 --> 00:05:29.736
(Ruolan Pavilion)

00:05:55.941 --> 00:05:56.541
Lord Xue.

00:05:56.902 --> 00:05:58.222
Ghost Painter takes lives.

00:05:58.421 --> 00:05:59.262
Think twice.

00:05:59.501 --> 00:06:01.262
It's urgent to find
the former Crown Prince.

00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:03.582
To confirm his identity,

00:06:04.181 --> 00:06:05.061
we must seek him.

00:06:05.342 --> 00:06:05.861
Lord Xue.

00:06:06.902 --> 00:06:07.662
I've decided.

00:06:08.213 --> 00:06:09.054
Guard outside.

00:06:10.054 --> 00:06:10.494
Yes.

00:07:01.213 --> 00:07:01.694
Sir,

00:07:02.293 --> 00:07:03.453
I seek your aid.

00:07:03.853 --> 00:07:05.093
Please help me.

00:07:06.014 --> 00:07:07.054
Since you're here,

00:07:07.374 --> 00:07:08.734
you must know my rules.

00:07:09.293 --> 00:07:10.134
I would follow them.

00:07:11.014 --> 00:07:13.853
Give me portraits
of the parents of the one you seek.

00:07:14.973 --> 00:07:15.973
In three days,

00:07:16.653 --> 00:07:17.614
you'll have answers.

00:07:18.453 --> 00:07:20.333
The more vital the subject,

00:07:20.893 --> 00:07:23.614
the greater price you'd pay.

00:07:29.893 --> 00:07:30.333
Lord Xue.

00:07:30.893 --> 00:07:31.944
It's the late emperor.

00:07:32.413 --> 00:07:33.533
But the late empress's...

00:07:35.453 --> 00:07:36.653
We couldn't find any portraits

00:07:37.054 --> 00:07:38.054
of late empress

00:07:38.054 --> 00:07:39.174
in the whole palace.

00:07:39.413 --> 00:07:39.814
Yes.

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:40.734
See.

00:07:44.374 --> 00:07:45.893
In the painting with late emperor,

00:07:46.333 --> 00:07:47.254
her face got burned.

00:07:48.734 --> 00:07:51.494
After His Majesty ascended the throne,
the late empress became taboo.

00:07:52.453 --> 00:07:54.614
Where could we find her portrait?

00:07:55.293 --> 00:07:57.453
Her maternal clan held no influence.

00:07:57.814 --> 00:08:00.456
After the late emperor fell ill,
she withdrew from all connections.

00:08:00.973 --> 00:08:01.694
I fear...

00:08:03.893 --> 00:08:05.333
The one who interacted with her

00:08:05.893 --> 00:08:07.333
and possess her portraits

00:08:08.174 --> 00:08:10.213
must hold significant status
in the imperial court.

00:08:15.911 --> 00:08:18.024
(Xue Mansion)

00:08:20.734 --> 00:08:22.893
(The late emperor,
late empress, and Lord Dingyuan)

00:08:23.174 --> 00:08:24.293
(were friends since youth.)

00:08:25.014 --> 00:08:25.934
(In a military defeat,)

00:08:26.014 --> 00:08:28.134
(the late empress pleaded
for Lord Dingyuan's life.)

00:08:28.853 --> 00:08:29.773
(So, he must)

00:08:30.413 --> 00:08:32.053
(keep a portrait of the late empress.)

00:09:18.573 --> 00:09:19.254
(Empress's Portrait)
(Late Empress!)

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:21.413
Mr. Xue.

00:09:21.614 --> 00:09:23.053
We heard intruders in this room.

00:09:36.494 --> 00:09:37.173
Search carefully.

00:09:37.413 --> 00:09:38.293
Check everything.

00:09:40.734 --> 00:09:41.494
Search and check

00:09:41.693 --> 00:09:42.293
carefully.

00:09:42.773 --> 00:09:43.173
Yes.

00:09:55.254 --> 00:09:56.734
(What's she up to now?)

00:10:13.813 --> 00:10:14.214
Father.

00:10:15.734 --> 00:10:16.134
Father.

00:10:20.893 --> 00:10:21.413
Everything...

00:10:21.854 --> 00:10:23.134
Everything is fine.

00:10:23.974 --> 00:10:24.454
But

00:10:24.893 --> 00:10:25.974
a painting is gone

00:10:27.014 --> 00:10:27.974
in the study.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:34.134
Father.

00:10:34.773 --> 00:10:35.454
Terrible!

00:10:35.693 --> 00:10:37.374
Lord has passed out again.

00:10:38.024 --> 00:10:39.624
(Xue Mansion)

00:10:46.693 --> 00:10:48.454
Mr. Xue, that way.

00:10:48.776 --> 00:10:49.293
Go then.

00:11:14.734 --> 00:11:15.214
Sir,

00:11:16.614 --> 00:11:17.454
the painting is here.

00:11:31.494 --> 00:11:32.773
The person you want to sketch is

00:11:41.334 --> 00:11:43.014
the former Crown Prince?

00:11:44.893 --> 00:11:45.334
Yes.

00:11:51.173 --> 00:11:52.173
In three days,

00:11:53.053 --> 00:11:54.614
pay me your life.

00:11:56.854 --> 00:11:57.614
Deal.

00:12:16.173 --> 00:12:16.808
(Young Master,)

00:12:17.653 --> 00:12:19.254
(we'll reunite soon.)

00:12:26.573 --> 00:12:27.494
After

00:12:28.293 --> 00:12:29.454
all these years,

00:12:30.293 --> 00:12:32.173
why do you still not let him off?

00:12:45.896 --> 00:12:48.264
(Ruolan Pavilion)

00:12:54.974 --> 00:12:56.254
What is this place?

00:12:56.813 --> 00:12:57.854
It's so creepy.

00:13:39.773 --> 00:13:40.893
This looks so fake.

00:13:43.854 --> 00:13:44.573
This one too.

00:13:49.614 --> 00:13:50.734
This looks real.

00:13:52.413 --> 00:13:52.933
He's writing.

00:13:53.893 --> 00:13:54.494
It's warm.

00:13:58.134 --> 00:13:58.773
The texture

00:13:59.653 --> 00:14:00.413
is nice.

00:14:00.933 --> 00:14:01.533
Impressive.

00:14:02.134 --> 00:14:02.974
Of course, it's real.

00:14:04.173 --> 00:14:05.533
Because I'm a living person.

00:14:07.413 --> 00:14:07.893
Sir.

00:14:08.254 --> 00:14:09.134
Why scared me?

00:14:09.693 --> 00:14:10.813
Why?

00:14:11.974 --> 00:14:12.933
If you were trapped here

00:14:12.933 --> 00:14:14.813
drawing 300 ghost money notes daily,

00:14:15.614 --> 00:14:17.334
you'd become more scary than me.

00:14:19.053 --> 00:14:21.094
Since you've discovered me,

00:14:22.254 --> 00:14:23.773
you won't leave here alive.

00:14:29.254 --> 00:14:30.334
You?

00:14:33.214 --> 00:14:33.933
You know me?

00:14:35.334 --> 00:14:36.014
Indeed.

00:14:36.813 --> 00:14:38.094
You resemble her a lot.

00:14:39.573 --> 00:14:40.094
Who?

00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:41.974
You know my father?

00:14:45.454 --> 00:14:47.334
Of course, I know your father.

00:14:48.653 --> 00:14:50.094
He's so noble

00:14:51.014 --> 00:14:53.533
that everyone knows him.

00:14:54.933 --> 00:14:55.854
Noble?

00:14:56.173 --> 00:14:57.533
He's just Lord Dingyuan,

00:14:57.773 --> 00:14:58.693
not that noble.

00:14:59.614 --> 00:15:00.813
Lord Dingyuan?

00:15:03.014 --> 00:15:04.094
You still don't know?

00:15:04.933 --> 00:15:05.494
Know what?

00:15:11.374 --> 00:15:12.614
Why are you chained here?

00:15:13.494 --> 00:15:14.413
I am

00:15:14.974 --> 00:15:17.293
the late empress's

00:15:17.573 --> 00:15:19.573
personally appointed chief painter,

00:15:19.933 --> 00:15:20.813
Hua Biliang.

00:15:21.974 --> 00:15:23.496
After Emperor Jia ascended the throne,

00:15:24.053 --> 00:15:25.773
he tortured me a lot,

00:15:27.374 --> 00:15:29.773
even trapped me here
drawing ghost money notes.

00:15:31.214 --> 00:15:31.974
Now,

00:15:33.094 --> 00:15:34.374
they call me

00:15:35.374 --> 00:15:36.933
Ghost Painter.

00:15:40.094 --> 00:15:41.448
You know the former Crown Prince?

00:15:41.813 --> 00:15:42.893
Know what he looks like?

00:15:46.014 --> 00:15:47.334
Can't tell you.

00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:49.653
Fine.

00:15:58.813 --> 00:16:02.374
This is the late empress's
final portrait.

00:16:03.293 --> 00:16:04.454
Take it and go.

00:16:05.374 --> 00:16:06.893
Go as far as you can.

00:16:20.374 --> 00:16:21.134
Sketch Jia Xun,

00:16:21.533 --> 00:16:22.293
or we'll all die.

00:16:58.374 --> 00:16:59.214
Iron Palm technique?

00:17:00.134 --> 00:17:00.893
Who's your master?

00:17:01.014 --> 00:17:01.813
No one.

00:17:02.014 --> 00:17:03.854
I've made
candied chestnuts for 30 years.

00:17:04.014 --> 00:17:06.093
If Mr. Xue needs help,
I'll stake my life to assist.

00:17:14.133 --> 00:17:14.734
Ancient Tomb?

00:17:15.533 --> 00:17:15.974
No.

00:17:16.454 --> 00:17:17.853
I'm just a noodle maker,

00:17:18.533 --> 00:17:19.813
here to help Mr. Xue.

00:17:31.093 --> 00:17:32.333
Shaolin Technique?

00:17:32.934 --> 00:17:35.454
I'm just a fish killer in the market.

00:17:36.053 --> 00:17:36.894
Chop you dead,

00:17:37.254 --> 00:17:38.773
then he wouldn't charge me rent.

00:17:48.093 --> 00:17:48.573
Despicable!

00:17:49.053 --> 00:17:49.613
Go get her!

00:17:54.414 --> 00:17:56.093
(Luckily, her inner energy is gone.)

00:17:56.093 --> 00:17:57.734
(Or they couldn't have held her up.)

00:18:02.333 --> 00:18:02.853
Sir.

00:18:03.654 --> 00:18:04.414
Let's leave.

00:18:04.853 --> 00:18:05.654
I can't.

00:18:06.694 --> 00:18:09.093
The chains binding me
are made of black iron,

00:18:09.454 --> 00:18:10.373
unable to be cut off.

00:18:11.293 --> 00:18:12.053
Easy.

00:18:12.494 --> 00:18:13.093
We can

00:18:13.573 --> 00:18:14.373
dissolve the metal.

00:18:15.454 --> 00:18:16.254
What?

00:18:17.133 --> 00:18:18.174
Why do you have this?

00:18:18.654 --> 00:18:19.454
Been doing business,

00:18:19.654 --> 00:18:20.934
and I collected some.

00:18:21.694 --> 00:18:22.454
Here, try it.

00:18:22.494 --> 00:18:22.934
Hurry!

00:18:32.254 --> 00:18:32.734
Good.

00:18:34.093 --> 00:18:35.414
Done now. Leave.

00:18:35.414 --> 00:18:35.894
Follow me.

00:18:39.694 --> 00:18:40.174
Oh, no.

00:18:40.813 --> 00:18:42.414
The imperial court has guards outside.

00:18:43.014 --> 00:18:43.813
We can't escape.

00:18:45.174 --> 00:18:45.734
Those people

00:18:46.414 --> 00:18:47.454
have been killed by them.

00:18:56.328 --> 00:18:56.813
Let's go.

00:18:57.934 --> 00:18:58.376
Go.

00:19:01.014 --> 00:19:01.533
Sir.

00:19:02.333 --> 00:19:03.293
Got you a carriage.

00:19:04.613 --> 00:19:05.494
Here's some money.

00:19:06.053 --> 00:19:06.573
Take it

00:19:06.974 --> 00:19:08.454
and find a place to enjoy your life.

00:19:14.934 --> 00:19:15.654
You are

00:19:16.894 --> 00:19:18.573
kind and gentle like her.

00:19:19.613 --> 00:19:20.853
But this

00:19:21.373 --> 00:19:22.934
also got her killed.

00:19:24.734 --> 00:19:25.533
I fear

00:19:27.573 --> 00:19:28.813
it might get you killed too.

00:19:30.773 --> 00:19:32.773
My father is truly a kind man.

00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:36.654
Do you know about your mother?

00:19:37.093 --> 00:19:37.613
Do you

00:19:38.373 --> 00:19:38.974
know my mother?

00:19:40.214 --> 00:19:40.813
No.

00:19:44.773 --> 00:19:45.613
To be honest,

00:19:46.773 --> 00:19:47.373
my mother

00:19:47.533 --> 00:19:49.894
died giving birth to me.

00:19:51.214 --> 00:19:52.813
I never got the chance to know her.

00:20:02.494 --> 00:20:04.414
Protect this painting.

00:20:05.613 --> 00:20:06.333
Because

00:20:07.654 --> 00:20:09.053
this is the only thing

00:20:10.014 --> 00:20:11.573
she left in this world.

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:31.080
(Empress's Portrait)

00:20:32.133 --> 00:20:32.934
Late empress?

00:20:40.734 --> 00:20:42.053
(What does this mean?)

00:20:42.734 --> 00:20:44.573
(Empress's Portrait)
(Everyone wants this.)

00:20:45.694 --> 00:20:46.133
(No way.)

00:20:46.694 --> 00:20:48.694
(I need to make Feng Zuoren think
I burned it,)

00:20:49.454 --> 00:20:50.974
(to keep it safe for my father.)

00:20:51.734 --> 00:20:53.734
(The more dangerous place, the safer.)

00:20:54.214 --> 00:20:55.093
(I need to hide it.)

00:20:55.813 --> 00:20:57.174
(She'll definitely come after it.)

00:20:59.093 --> 00:20:59.813
(Where to put it?)

00:21:04.014 --> 00:21:04.533
(Here then.)

00:21:10.494 --> 00:21:11.254
(Burn this one.)

00:21:16.934 --> 00:21:17.533
Where's Hexu?

00:21:17.974 --> 00:21:19.254
Madam, he's in his room.

00:21:30.853 --> 00:21:31.414
(Three.)

00:21:32.454 --> 00:21:32.894
(Two.)

00:21:33.813 --> 00:21:34.214
(One.)

00:21:40.174 --> 00:21:41.734
Why did you burn this portrait?

00:21:41.853 --> 00:21:42.654
It's our property.

00:21:42.934 --> 00:21:43.734
Why do you care?

00:21:43.734 --> 00:21:45.573
Do you really think I won't kill you?

00:21:45.694 --> 00:21:46.214
What?

00:21:46.734 --> 00:21:47.894
I never think so.

00:21:48.494 --> 00:21:50.333
You even dare massacre the Xue family.

00:21:50.414 --> 00:21:52.573
You're the one trying
to destroy the Xue family.

00:21:53.053 --> 00:21:54.654
Only with this portrait can I find

00:21:54.813 --> 00:21:56.133
the former Crown Prince.

00:21:56.552 --> 00:21:57.333
What?

00:22:02.853 --> 00:22:03.494
Mr. Immortal.

00:22:04.174 --> 00:22:05.894
What's date today?

00:22:07.773 --> 00:22:08.494
Your Majesty,

00:22:09.734 --> 00:22:12.573
it's past midnight,
already the fourth day.

00:22:14.454 --> 00:22:16.533
When did Feng Zuoren receive the decree?

00:22:17.214 --> 00:22:19.333
Miss Feng received it on the first day.

00:22:19.773 --> 00:22:21.053
You gave her three days.

00:22:21.174 --> 00:22:22.888
Now it's the fourth day,

00:22:22.888 --> 00:22:24.053
yet she hasn't returned.

00:22:25.573 --> 00:22:28.573
Perhaps she's busy.

00:22:28.974 --> 00:22:30.694
Then let the Chief
of the Imperial Household

00:22:31.694 --> 00:22:32.974
go remind her.

00:22:39.734 --> 00:22:41.293
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:22:41.293 --> 00:22:43.624
(Xue Street)

00:22:48.573 --> 00:22:49.853
(The deadline has passed.)

00:22:50.214 --> 00:22:51.533
(All clues have been cut off.)

00:22:52.293 --> 00:22:53.613
(How will I tell His Majesty?)

00:23:21.093 --> 00:23:23.053
You seem well, Lord Xue.

00:23:23.813 --> 00:23:25.133
What are you

00:23:25.293 --> 00:23:26.894
rushing off to do?

00:23:31.494 --> 00:23:32.254
Chief.

00:23:33.373 --> 00:23:35.133
His Majesty intends to kill me?

00:23:37.214 --> 00:23:39.974
Since you cannot complete the mission,

00:23:40.414 --> 00:23:42.053
His Majesty sent me

00:23:42.454 --> 00:23:45.014
to give you a clean death.

00:23:49.133 --> 00:23:50.333
I failed the mission,

00:23:51.254 --> 00:23:52.254
shall be executed.

00:24:02.721 --> 00:24:03.880
(Deadly Poison)

00:24:07.144 --> 00:24:08.104
(Deadly Poison)

00:24:17.053 --> 00:24:17.813
I'm grateful

00:24:18.573 --> 00:24:21.053
for His Majesty's mercy.
