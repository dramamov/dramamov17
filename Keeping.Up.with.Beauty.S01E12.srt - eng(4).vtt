=Episode 12=

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.840
But,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.679
Miss,

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.759
Gu Chenyu is already
the head of the Gu family.

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:05.280
So many eyes are on him outside.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.760
What exactly is your relationship
with him now?

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.959
You're still staying by his side,

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:10.120
are you trying to...

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.000
Nonsense.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.519
I...

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.640
What kind of relationship
could I have with him?

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.359
How could I possibly
have feelings for him?

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.159
Ridiculous.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.400
I just want to ask,

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:26.519
are you planning to cooperate
with him to run Jiangxing?

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:29.519
Did I not make myself clear?

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.439
Does anyone have any objections
to Director Zhou's proposal?

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:34.680
- No.
- No.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.040
Then no objections.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.480
Let's implement Director Zhou's plan.

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:39.640
Today's meeting

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.280
ends here.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.680
Mr. Gu.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.760
Something happened.

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.719
Son!

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.120
Son!

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:51.000
Doctor!

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.280
How is he?

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.840
Doctor!

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:52.879
Doctor!

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:53.959
Tell us!

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.159
It was severe liver and kidney failure

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.439
caused by acute food poisoning.

00:01:59.079 --> 00:01:59.799
We did our best.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.560
Doctor!

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.799
Doctor!

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.040
Son!

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.519
Dear reporters,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.120
Jiangxing Hotel

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.240
has serious food safety issues.

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:14.520
The child only ate one meal

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.919
and was gone.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.680
He was only sixteen!

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.039
Jiangxing Hotel is extremely heartless!

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.479
Give me back my son!

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.759
Give me back my son!

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:28.719
(Pause operations)

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:31.360
How will you address Jiangxing's
food safety problems?

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.199
Food safety issues

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:33.759
are a top priority in our country.

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:35.800
How could such a problem occur
in your hotel?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.280
Why hasn't Mr. Gu Chenyu of the group

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.599
shown up?

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:39.199
Yes.

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:40.000
Why not show up?

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:42.400
First of all,

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.960
I want to apologize to everyone.

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:45.479
We are still investigating.

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:48.159
Renowned Jiangxing Hotel has
an outbreak of food poisoning.

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:50.080
A minor lost his life as a result.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.439
The hotel has been temporarily closed.

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.879
Gu Group's stock
has dropped significantly.

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.140
The new president, Mr. Gu Chenyu

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.800
is being questioned on his
management abilities.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.319
Facing scrutiny and accountability,

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.400
as for the follow-up...

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.599
Slander.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.439
This is simply slander.

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:07.759
Jiangxing Restaurant
has been open for decades.

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:10.879
Chef Li was personally recruited back
by Mr. Fu at the time.

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.439
There has never been
a food safety issue!

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.360
Clearly someone is framing Jiangxing.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.560
I understand, Uncle Wang.

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:17.719
Don't worry.

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:20.120
I will find a way
to prove Jiangxing's innocence.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.150
I've already sent my assistant
to the hospital to investigate.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.919
The deceased was cremated
immediately after death.

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:27.400
Previous medical records were deleted.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.879
Most suspiciously,

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.759
the doctor who issued
the food poisoning diagnosis

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:33.080
is named Wang Hao.

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:34.960
He suddenly resigned yesterday.

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:36.120
It must be him.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.120
He was instructed
to falsify the diagnosis.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.080
If the diagnosis was indeed forged,

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:42.960
then that person
has surely already fled.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.680
Where can we find him?

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:47.039
I know where he is.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.800
Yunyun.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.000
Don't trust him.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.759
This whole thing might have been
set up by him.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.400
Gu Yansheng, you go out.

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:56.439
You're not welcome here.

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.319
I know you hate me right now.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.960
I'm stubborn.

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:05.199
I'm ruthless.

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:07.680
But I never intended to hurt you.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.560
And I would never touch Jiangxing.

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:14.400
I swear

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.480
I really didn't know
about this in advance.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.639
If I had even an inkling beforehand,

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:21.439
I would have done everything
I could to stop it.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.040
Because I know how important
this hotel is to you.

00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:27.480
Yunyun.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.040
We've known each other
since we were ten.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.000
Do you

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.759
not even have the slightest
trust left in me?

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:38.360
(No matter what,)

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:41.240
(he still loves Fu Yunyun deeply.)

00:04:53.079 --> 00:04:53.680
Okay.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.680
Yunyun.

00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:59.120
Then tell me,

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.480
where is that doctor?

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:01.959
According to my investigation,

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.639
before Wang Hao resigned,

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.480
he bought a large supply
of motion sickness medicine.

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:07.600
He has a cousin who works at the dock

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:09.759
who was once imprisoned
for illegal smuggling.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.000
I suspect he's at the dock now

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.279
and preparing to escape by boat.

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:15.199
Then we'll head to the dock now.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.959
Uncle Wang.

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:17.279
Wait here for our news.

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.959
Be careful.

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:18.360
Okay.

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:19.160
Let's go.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.759
Move!

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.240
I'll handle this.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.000
I'll handle it.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.279
Move, this is my car!

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.990
Stop messing around!

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:31.319
I'll take her to the dock.

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:32.720
Why do you insist on coming along?

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.480
Do you know who I am to her?

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:36.360
Obeying her is my duty.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.160
Protecting her is my mission.

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:39.319
Right.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.600
Muyan is right.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.959
I'll go with him.

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:42.480
Yansheng.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.120
You go back first.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.800
No!

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:48.319
The dock is full of all kinds of people,

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:49.639
you never know who's a bad guy.

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:51.279
How can that pretty boy protect you?

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:53.519
Who are you calling a pretty boy?

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.480
When I was in the army,

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.199
your ancestors weren't even born yet.

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:57.839
Army?

00:05:58.639 --> 00:05:59.120
You?

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.759
Alright.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:01.279
Everyone get in the car.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.600
Follow my orders.
Those who disobey will be punished.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.240
Yes.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.480
On the surface,

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.199
this incident targets Jiangxing Hotel.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.360
But actually,

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.079
it's aimed at you.

00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:23.079
You just became head of the Gu family,

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:24.759
your foundation is unstable,

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.319
This is the easiest time
to be questioned and opposed.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.480
Since Jiangxing was acquired,

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.879
you've been in charge of managing it.

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:36.720
As long as something
goes wrong at Jiangxing,

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:40.240
they will throw the blame on you.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.759
Once your reputation is ruined,

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:45.240
you won't be able to stay
as head of the family.

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:48.160
Tell me.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.120
How are you going to solve this?

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:54.040
Find the person behind this

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.879
and prove Jiangxing's innocence.

00:06:56.519 --> 00:06:57.279
Wrong.

00:06:57.879 --> 00:06:59.680
That's the logic of ordinary people.

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:01.720
As the head of the Gu family,

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:03.959
you have to stand higher

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.480
and see further.

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:10.759
Who orchestrated this incident?

00:07:10.959 --> 00:07:12.839
Can't you figure it out?

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.360
Bai Lanxing and Gu Yansheng.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.199
One is your stepmother,

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:20.439
one is your sibling.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.279
Even if it's a struggle
for the head position,

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.720
it shouldn't spill into the public.

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:30.519
This time it's already in the news.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.199
If you demand the truth,

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.600
and expose all the filthy,
dirty secrets within the Gu family,

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.439
and make everyone knows,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.199
it would only harm the company
without any benefit.

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:46.480
Then should we just watch
Jiangxing be slandered

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.800
and be forced to close?

00:07:48.079 --> 00:07:49.480
Think carefully.

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:52.160
Actually,

00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:58.079
there's a perfect solution
that satisfies both sides.

00:08:13.959 --> 00:08:15.879
That person is Wang Hao.

00:08:21.399 --> 00:08:22.920
I've arrived.

00:08:25.079 --> 00:08:25.480
There!

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.959
He's getting on the boat!

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.799
Still dare to call me a pretty boy?

00:09:02.799 --> 00:09:03.279
Don't come over!

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:03.879
Let her go!

00:09:04.279 --> 00:09:04.799
Don't come over!

00:09:04.799 --> 00:09:05.480
Let me go!

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.159
If you dare touch her,

00:09:09.159 --> 00:09:10.200
you're finished!

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.480
Don't come over!

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.840
Let me go!

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.279
Let go of me!

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.200
Tell me.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.399
Did you forge the diagnosis?

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.879
What really happened
to the patient at Jiangxing Hotel

00:09:26.879 --> 00:09:27.960
who had food poisoning?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:30.679
I'm sorry.

00:09:31.039 --> 00:09:32.320
Truly sorry.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.279
I only did this
because I had no way out.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.919
They threatened me
with my sick hospitalized daughter.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.480
If I didn't do as they said,
they would...

00:09:39.039 --> 00:09:39.480
They would...

00:09:40.919 --> 00:09:42.159
I have a video on my phone!

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.279
A video.

00:09:47.559 --> 00:09:48.159
Wang Hao.

00:09:48.679 --> 00:09:51.159
Do what I told you to do properly.

00:09:51.159 --> 00:09:52.120
Look.

00:09:54.039 --> 00:09:56.039
What a cute girl.

00:09:56.639 --> 00:09:58.399
If something happened to her,

00:09:58.399 --> 00:09:59.919
what would you do?

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.360
If everything goes well,

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.639
she'll be able
to have surgery successfully.

00:10:05.039 --> 00:10:06.399
If it doesn't go well...

00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:17.840
Who is the person

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.519
threatening you with your daughter?

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.240
I can't say.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.399
Can't say.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:26.720
I'll tell.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:28.879
I've seen

00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:31.039
that person in the news.

00:10:31.679 --> 00:10:32.080
Called...

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:34.159
Called...

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:35.600
Gu Chenyu.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.840
