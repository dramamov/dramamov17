Who let you in?

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.040
Get out.

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:07.079
I'm warning you.

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:08.280
Your brother's inside.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.079
He's here,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.719
and that makes you so happy?

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.959
Has my brother ever touched you?

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:20.480
Here.

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:27.359
Here...

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.319
Or…

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.480
Enough already.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.480
Fu Yunyun.

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:39.560
What are you doing?

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.840
I'm making the bed.

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:41.879
Perfect timing.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.760
Let my brother see what we're up to.

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:04.879
Fu Yunyun.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.519
What tricks are you playing now?

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.360
Yunyun.

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:35.680
Don't go, Yunyun.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.879
I really miss you.

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:42.120
Yunyun.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.319
Good day, Young Madam.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.439

(Hongshi Charity Auction)

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.700
(Gilded Enamel Jade Command Command
of Great Liang)

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.879
Nangong Yu, listen to my command.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.319
I am here.

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:54.759
From tomorrow onward,

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:57.319
(General Nangong)
you shall be the General of the Southern Wind Camp.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.960
This command token,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.199
I entrust it to you.

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.919
Yes.

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:09.360
Father.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.639
Why is half of it missing?

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:12.960
Our Nangong ancestors

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:14.599
were once saved by another family.

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:17.519
Half of this command token's jade

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:19.199
was gifted to our benefactor.

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:20.959
And a pact was made

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.439
that one day,

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.319
should the benefactor's family
fall into hardship,

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.199
our descendants of the Nangong clan

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:28.519
will repay that debt of gratitude,

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:29.720
even at the cost of their lives.

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:31.879
So this command token

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:34.120
is not only a symbol of command
over the Southern Wind Camp,

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:35.560
but also represents

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:37.360
a promise
that can reverse life and death

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.519
and transcend time itself.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.040
Reverse life and death…

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:45.439
Transcend time…

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.639
(Command)
Bound by life itself.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.360
A vow that endures
beyond life and death.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.399
Could it be that I came here

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.800
because of this command token?

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.420
(The Gilded Enamel Jade Command Command

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.879
It tastes amazing.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.560
Morning.

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:24.519
Did you sleep well last night?

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.480
Fu Yunyun.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.240
You've grown bold.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.360
What do you mean by that?

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.399
You all passed out last night.

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:35.800
I was worried you'd catch a cold,
so I covered you with a blanket.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.360
Then I should thank you, shouldn't I?

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.199
You're welcome.

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:42.199
What exactly are you planning?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.120
I'm going to the auction.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.860
(Hongshi Charity Auction)

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:03.680
I saw this on the coffee table,

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.120
an auction catalogue
from the charity event.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.360
It says that invited guests

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.439
may bring family members along.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.600
Can you take me with you?

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.680
No.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.519
Why not?

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:17.199
We're married, aren't we?

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:18.519
Didn't you say so yourself yesterday?

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.439
That doesn't count.

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:23.040
Come on,

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.639
don't be so petty.

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:28.600
There's something there I really need.

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:33.079
Still no.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.240
When you go out, remember your status.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.759
I'm not ready to make
our relationship public yet.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.959
Fine.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.879
If I can't count on others,
I'll count on myself.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:50.879
All right.

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:51.360
Watch this.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.279
Perfect.

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:56.519
Hello.

00:06:56.519 --> 00:06:57.680
Please show your invitation.

00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:00.560
Thank you, here you go.

00:07:01.519 --> 00:07:02.199
This way, please.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.000
Smile, please.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.519
Here you go.

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:07.720
Here, please. Come in.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.800
Please show your invitation.

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.040
(Too many people here.
It's not safe to take risks.)

00:07:16.079 --> 00:07:18.439
(It seems I'll need to find
a way to get an invitation.)

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.120
Please come in.

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:29.879
Yan.

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:31.199
Where on earth did you go?

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.759
You're a big star.

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:33.959
You can't just wander off alone.

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:37.759
I went to the auction
to buy a few things.

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:39.319
The auction?

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.920
Isn't that a public event?

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.560
Stop talking nonsense.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.120
Did you find the person I asked you to?

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.399
There's no photo.

00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:49.720
With just a few vague descriptions,

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.240
it's like finding
a needle in a haystack.

00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:52.800
I don't care what it takes.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.160
No matter the cost,

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.399
keep looking.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:56.839
Understood.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.060
(The Gilded Enamel Jade Command
Command of Great Liang)

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.160
You've got good reflexes.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.480
Who are you?

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.160
A fan?

00:08:24.079 --> 00:08:25.000
Fan?

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.680
As in…

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.000
The edible kind?

00:08:29.839 --> 00:08:30.759
Drop the act.

00:08:31.439 --> 00:08:32.919
You want a photo or an autograph?

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:33.879
Just say it.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.840
I want that invitation in your pocket.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:37.720
Name your price.

00:08:39.759 --> 00:08:40.639
Sorry,

00:08:41.759 --> 00:08:42.799
this invitation

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:43.759
isn't for sale.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.720
Then don't blame me for being rude.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.039
General.

00:09:34.759 --> 00:09:35.879
My apologies,

00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:37.000
sir.

00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:38.120
But I must attend

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:38.879
today's auction.

00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:40.639
Name your price.

00:09:44.039 --> 00:09:44.970
You should've said so earlier.

00:09:45.799 --> 00:09:47.320
There's no need to fight.

00:09:47.919 --> 00:09:49.200
And no need for money, either.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:50.919
We can just

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.279
go together.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.600
Really?

00:09:55.639 --> 00:09:56.440
As long as you

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.240
don't mind being my date.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.020
