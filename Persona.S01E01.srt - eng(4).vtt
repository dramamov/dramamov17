Well.

Faster, please.

How much is it?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.350
- We have it.
- How much?

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:18.710

Is it always so hot here?

It's still snowing in Chencang.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.800
like spring in your northern cities.

Spring?

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.040
What's wrong?
You got a grudge against spring?

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.190
Not really.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.190

I haven't had time to fix it.

It's fine.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.470

- It's okay.

- Yeah.

June 16th of last year,

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.390
Qin Hong committed a murder in Chencang

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.270
and vanished without a trace.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.750
We've been tracking her for over a year.

Qin Hong's bank card in Pingtan.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.620
We investigate it once noticed.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:52.630
But the person using the card
wasn't Qin Hong.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:53.480
It was a man.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:55.960

No idea.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.600
Where were you two days ago?

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:33.440
Two days ago...

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:35.510
I don't remember.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:37.600
Is this you?

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.360
Looks like it.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.370

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.320
Officer,

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.870
I handle a ton of things every day.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.510
I honestly can't keep track.

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:56.510
This is the card you used
to withdraw the money.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.080
Is this card under your name?

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:05.910
I don't think so.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:07.080
Then whose is it?

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.030
A friend's.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.360
Is this her?

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:31.960
Looks like her.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.000
Make sure.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.080
Don't be ambiguous.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.150
She kind of resembles her.

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:39.080
But...

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.510
Her hairstyle's different.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:43.910
What's her name?

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.030
Lin Chang.

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:51.630
Why is her card with you?

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.370
She borrowed some money from me.

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:57.360
When she paid me back,
she gave me the card.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.730
What's your relationship with her?

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:00.240
Why'd she borrow money from you?

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.990
We're friends.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.120
What does your friend do?

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.550
She seems to run a clothing store.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:16.910
Where is she now?

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:31.470
Not sure.

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:36.600
What's the store called?

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:39.150
It's called

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.630
Tian Cai.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.700

This store belongs to you?

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.270
One of them, yeah.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:26.700
Those few over there are mine, too.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.390
Quite the landlord.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.370
Just collecting some rent money.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.750
How long has this place been closed?

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:47.600
Haven't seen Ms. Lin for over a week.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.160
Do you mean

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:51.320
this woman?

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.510
Yeah, that's her.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:54.960
Ms. Lin Chang.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.150
(Tian Cai)

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:57.360
What do you guys need her for?

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.790
Do you know where she is now?

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.000
Not really.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.670
I called her days ago.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.240
Her phone's been off.

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:10.550
It really is Qin Hong.

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:17.030
The clothing store she ran in Chencang

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:18.000
was called Tian Cai.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:19.390
The same style.

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:21.870
Judging by the store,

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:23.440
I don't think she planned it.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.270
I'll call the bureau now

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:26.910
and have them start checking the area.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.080
Officer.

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:35.840
What happened to Ms. Lin?

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:38.790
Who's that Qin you mentioned?

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.320
Do you know Ma Weicheng?

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:42.390
Yeah.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:44.670
His store is inside that alley.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:47.840
Come on.

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:53.940
(Tian Cai)

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.160
That one.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.390
The health product store is his.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.550
The people who store there

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:02.000
are all elderly folks.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.030
He somehow managed

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:04.670
to brainwash those seniors.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.270
They call him

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:07.550
Mr. Ma.

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:08.790
He used to cozy up to me

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.600
and give me some health products.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.600
I ended up with stomach trouble.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:14.200
Total scam.

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:15.840
Qin Hong and he...

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.670
What's his relationship with Lin Chang?

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:20.920
Relationship?

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:24.480
If you ask me,

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:27.580
it's more like a manipulator
and a victim.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.750
Ms. Lin told me once

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.790
that Ma Weicheng kept bothering her.

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:35.510
Bothering her?

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:37.560
Ma Weicheng had a crush on Ms. Lin.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.080
Ms. Lin didn't feel the same way.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.480
One time,
I asked Ms. Lin out for dinner.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.150
That night, she opened up,

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.440
saying she'd been anxious.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.150
She said that Ma Weicheng

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:48.870
just wouldn't stop pestering her.

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:50.390
Listen.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.200
Ma Weicheng isn't mentally stable.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:54.560
He even scratched my car.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:55.590
I caught him

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:57.790
and taught him a lesson.

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:00.630
Why would Lin Chang tell you this?

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:04.600
Maybe Ms. Lin likes me more.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.550
I'm the kind of man

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:08.910
who makes women feel safe around me.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.380
(People's Police)

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:17.790
I've told you everything.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.910
Lin Chang borrowed money from me.

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:22.170
When it was time to pay me back,

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:23.390
she handed me her card.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:25.030
Was there any money in that card?

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.670
It was a frozen account.

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:31.200
What money could you withdraw from it?

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.480
Yeah, it was frozen.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.960
I only found out
after going to the bank.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.750
How much did you lend her?

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.270
150 thousand.

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:40.390
Did you have her sign an IOU?

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.670
No.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:43.670
You said you two weren't close,

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:44.840
just friends at best.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.720
Yet, she borrowed 150 thousand

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.600
from you without an IOU?

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.480
I get it now, okay?

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.350
If any friend borrows money again,

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:53.520
I'll make sure there's an IOU.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.240
Officer,

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.510
I'm a victim, too.

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.360
Can you help me get my money back?

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.240
Ma Weicheng,
I'm asking you one last time.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.600
What exactly is your relationship
with Lin Chang?

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:08.720
We're just friends.

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:11.070
We talked to the nearby store owners.

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:14.110
They said they often saw you
visiting Tian Cai to meet her.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.070
They also saw Lin Chang
going to see you.

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:18.790
Some even said you kept bothering her.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.400
That's nonsense.

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:24.510
Why would I bother her?

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:32.950
Alright.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.130
Our relationship

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.790
is a bit closer than normal friends.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.510
What do you mean

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:45.750
by that?

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.440
Well.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.030
We're not exactly a couple yet.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.480
Got it?

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:54.880
Do you know

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.830
Lin Chang's store

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:59.750
hasn't been open for a week?

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:02.630
Yeah.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.550
Did you try to contact her
during that time?

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:08.750
I did.

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:09.880
But I couldn't reach her.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.960
Do you know
your girlfriend Lin Chang well?

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.480
Officer, first of all,
she's not my girlfriend.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:20.950
Secondly,

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.830
I only know she came from Chencang.

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:24.680
Right?

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:25.680
She's new here

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.890
and doesn't have many friends.

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:28.400
That's all I know.

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:42.350

Your girlfriend, Lin Chang,

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:46.680
is actually Qin Hong.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.720
She's wanted for murder.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:53.350
I swear I had no idea.

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:55.160
When I met her, she was Lin Chang.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.160
You said just now
that you tried to reach her.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.200
I even saw her ID card.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.000
- We checked your call records.
- Really.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.020
Starting from a week ago,

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.260
you haven't called her once.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.680
Can I assume something here?

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.750
You knew you couldn't

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.200
get through to her.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.640
No, I went to find her in person.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.230
- I didn't find her.
- Where did she go?

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.480
If you know where she is

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.640
and you don't tell us,

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:33.070
you'll be held legally responsible.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.320
I know.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.160
No, I don't know.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:39.550
I swear.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.440
I honestly don't know where she is.

You're back.

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:02.230

has been issued.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.320
Good work.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:04.640

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.350
No, thanks.

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:07.310
Really?

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:08.150
Chief Liu.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.830
Do you think Ma Weicheng

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:12.830
knows where Qin Hong is?

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:16.510
I believe he does.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.960
Though he answered

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.400
all of our questions.

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:22.590
But a lot of what he said
doesn't add up.

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:25.350
What's the biggest flaw in his story?

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:29.270
If he truly didn't know
Qin Hong's real identity,

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:31.070
why did he hide his relationship

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:32.640
with her from us at first?

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:34.550
It wasn't until we found new proof,

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:35.880
which contradicted his story,

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:37.880
that he admitted they were connected.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:40.960

Please step aside.

Over here.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.590

of blood on the wall.

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:15.400
Around the bloodstains,

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.550
there are marks from a scraping tool.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.240
We found

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.680
that they belong

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:22.990
to Ma Weicheng and Qin Hong.

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:24.340
This indirectly confirms

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:26.720
(Criminal Investigation Division)
Ma Weicheng's statement.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:27.310
Those two had

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:28.550
a rather close relationship.

In addition,

(Blood DNA Test)
in the bedroom.

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:35.880
It's human blood.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.750
And the DNA profile matched

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:39.440
Qin Hong's record in the database.

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:43.240
This is the environment
of the crime scene.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.100
(Crime Scene Environment)
On the bedroom wall,

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:48.920
(On-site Examination)
there were splatter-like blood traces.

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:51.160
But the wall surface had been damaged.

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:52.350
We believe

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.310
Qin Hong was likely injured

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:55.880
by a sharp object here.

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:59.200
Blood then splattered across the walls.

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.410
Under the forensic light,
the bloodstains

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:02.610
confirmed our assumption.

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:05.030
After Qin Hong fell to the ground,

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:06.830
she was dragged into the compartment.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.400
The scene had been wiped down,

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:09.960
so we couldn't determine

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.400
from the traces alone

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:14.300
whether Qin Hong tried to fight back.

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:15.160
However,

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.240
based on the bloodstains,

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.550
we estimate the amount of blood loss

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:20.960
has exceeded 1,000 cc.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.000
We visited

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.590
medical institutions across the city.

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:26.640
It turns out none of them

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.640
had any records matching

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.310
a patient with that level of blood loss.

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:31.200
The blood bank also didn't receive

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.110
any blood request of that specific type.

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:35.120
With such a huge amount of blood loss,

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.680
if she didn't receive
timely medical care

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:39.550
and an emergency transfusion...

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:44.760

she is

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:49.150

What was the weapon?

Inside the toolbox
at the health product store,

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.030
we found a screwdriver.

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:01.510
There were traces of Qin Hong's blood

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.170
and Ma Weicheng's fingerprints.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.350
We found a large amount of blood
in your home.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.480
DNA tests confirmed

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.880
it belongs to Qin Hong,

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.480
that is, Lin Chang.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.320

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:16.400
I honestly have no idea what's going on.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.790
This screwdriver

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:22.160
was found in the toolbox at your store.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.720
There's Qin Hong's blood on it.

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.600
And your fingerprints, too.

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:28.350
If that's my screwdriver,

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:29.650
it'd surely have my fingerprints.

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:31.590
But I really don't know

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:33.270
why her blood would be on it.

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:34.680
On the night of Nov. 27,

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.790
someone saw Lin Chang enter your home.

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:38.240
What were you two doing?

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.310
Having dinner.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:49.880
A neighbor said they heard

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.880
arguing and a struggle.

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:54.390
No way.

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:56.910
They're wrong.

00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:59.560
That noise didn't come from our place.

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:00.750
Stop talking.

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:01.920
She left right after dinner.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.320
Alright.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.350
Let's assume she did leave.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.590
Where did you go after she left?

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:10.550
I can't remember.

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:16.510
Then let me help you recall.

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:25.780
(2013/11/28 Thursday,
Tiantai'an Health Products)

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:26.630
That's you, right?

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:31.480
Alone at night,

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.110
you moved a box into your car

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:35.640
and then drove toward the seaside.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.480
What were you doing?

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.160
The surveillance never caught

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:46.750
Lin Chang leaving your house.

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:50.110
From Nov. 28 onward.

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:51.720
Lin Chang never showed up again.

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:54.110
Her clothing store never reopened.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.000
Are you sure she left?

00:26:58.550 --> 00:26:59.720
Ma Weicheng.

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:01.240
Tell us the truth.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.270
Is Lin Chang still alive?

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:09.590
Your silence won't change a thing.

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:13.160
This is your chance to confess.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.510
Answer me honestly.

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.200
- No.
- My medicine.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:17.880
I didn't kill her.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.440
Did you kill Lin Chang?

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:21.480
I didn't kill her.

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:22.680
I swear it wasn't me.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.440
If you didn't,

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:28.680
who did?

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.480
She had a congenital heart disease.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.070
When we were together,

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:46.010
she had a few episodes.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.780
But every time, the medicine cured her.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:51.400
That day, she ran out of medicine.

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.280
Wait here.

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:53.400
I'll go get the medicine.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.240
Just wait here.

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:56.470
So, I went to buy it for her.

00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:58.960
By the time I came back,

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:00.400
she was already gone.

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.480
Where's the body?

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.480
Alright.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:15.760
Ma Weicheng.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.930
Let's not waste any more time.

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.550
Since we started questioning you,

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:20.510
you've given us

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:22.480
three different versions of your story.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.070
That's proof you're resisting
the interrogation.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.030
What we found in your house

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:28.310
was enough to tell us everything.

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:29.510
It's enough to convict you.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:30.920
Let's end the interrogation here.

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:31.930
Okay? Let's go.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.720
Officer.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:34.760
Officer, Officer.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.400
If I tell the truth, will you help me?

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:01.510
I threw her body into the sea.

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:09.240
We did have a fight that day.

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.510
After she gave me her bank card,

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.610
she wanted to break up with me.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.240
I asked her why.

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:21.110
She said she liked someone else.

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:23.310
I was furious.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.350
I lost control and hit her.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.560
My medicine.

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:29.790
Stop pretending.

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:31.320
- My medicine.
- After that,

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:32.920
I went to buy medicine for her,

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:35.680
as I told you.

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:40.350
If she died of a heart condition,

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:42.350
why did you dump the body?

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:45.070
Because I was scared.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:47.840
I couldn't explain

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.440
whether her illness and death

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.640
were connected to me.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.110
Lin Chang once told me

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.110
that she wanted to escape her past,

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:02.640
so she came to Pingtan alone.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.440
I decided to take a chance on that.

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.480
I thought no one would look for her.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.030
But I honestly had no idea

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:15.310
whether she'd ever killed someone

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:17.200
or if she was a wanted murderer.

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:20.310
As for those photos
you showed me just now,

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:21.550
I really don't know

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:22.830
the story behind them.

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:24.200
I'm telling you the truth.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.980
There are plenty of contradictions

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:33.440
between Ma Weicheng's testimony

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.960
and the evidence we found at the scene.

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:37.110
Though he admitted

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:38.820
that Qin Hong died
from a heart condition

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.580
after he attacked her,

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:43.200
it's more likely that Qin Hong

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:44.640
was violently killed by Ma Weicheng

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.590
based on the evidence we've gathered.

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:48.840
Reefs are everywhere down there.

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.690
The suitcase Ma Weicheng used
to dump the body

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:51.990
shouldn't be too hard to locate.

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:53.440
It's all volcanic rock underneath.

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.480
When the tide comes in,
it's completely submerged.

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:57.480
The body has been soaking
for over 10 days.

00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:59.720
Most likely, gases have built up inside,

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.070
changing the pressure
inside the suitcase,

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:04.200
so it might've been swept away
by the current.

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:07.000
The current?

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:12.110
Normally, there aren't many people
around here at night.

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:14.160
But that night, he came rushing in,

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.200
in need of Xin Kang Fu.

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:17.700
Oh, right.

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:19.350
I remember he seemed to have a wound

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:20.190
around this area.

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.270
It could be from a recent fight.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.830
The currents here have their direction.

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:26.370
A body would drift to a fixed location

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:27.350
along with the current.

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:28.830
Our experts are looking into it.

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:30.510
Is this him?

00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:32.480
To see if it's this person.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.200
- Yes.
- Ma Weicheng

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.160
did go to buy medicine that night.

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:37.960
I don't think

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.880
we can believe Ma Weicheng.

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:42.550
We've questioned him several times,

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:44.640
and he's always overturned
his previous statements.

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:46.920
It wasn't until we put the evidence

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.070
right in front of him

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:50.160
that he realized he couldn't get away

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.130
and finally admitted
to Qin Hong's death.

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:54.720
So, he's good at dodging the real issue.

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:57.240
Do you have

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.200
erythromycin ointment?

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.750
He only bought Xin Kang Fu,

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:03.000
not the erythromycin ointment.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.440
I know. It's for me.

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:05.680
How much?

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.270
Five yuan.

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:08.160
Give me two boxes.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.000
Thanks.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.250
Thanks.

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:12.110
We looked into Ma Weicheng before.

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:13.620
He served three years for fraud.

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:15.030
(CIU File; Ma Weicheng)
Back then,

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:16.700
he was running a pretty big company.

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:17.880
(Jiankanglu Health Technology)

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.680
He tricked a lot of senior citizens

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.200
by selling fake medical equipment.

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.240
So, Ma Weicheng

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.350
is really something.

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:26.790
From what I see,

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.110
he won't tell us the truth

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:30.110
unless we corner him.

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:31.640
He definitely knows

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.640
that if we can't find the body,

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:34.830
we can't determine

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:36.480
the cause

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:37.920
of Qin Hong's death.

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:39.830
And that will directly affect

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.920
his sentence.

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:45.030
So, we have to locate the body

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:47.590
to uncover the truth.

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:07.510
I just came from the bureau.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.110
Sorry for being late.

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.350
Any updates from the salvage team?

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:14.720
Nothing for now.

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:22.110
But the current expert said

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:24.640
they've found some coordinates.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.400
We've run a field test

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:28.300
by dumping a box with the same weight

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:29.260
from the cliff.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.640
Every time it resurfaced,
it was at those exact spots.

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:35.720
Then why haven't we found

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.400
the suitcase that held Qin Hong's body?

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.120
After all, it's just an experiment.

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.440
It's not 100% certain.

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.240
But it's helped us narrow things down.

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:56.030
Have you come across
a similar case before?

00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.380
About a year ago, yes.

00:33:58.790 --> 00:33:59.830
Also a body in the sea.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:04.000
Did you find the body?

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.910
Yeah.

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.310
A month after the crime,

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:10.920
the provincial police down south

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.480
found it near the shore.

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:23.550
Xiaoxiao.

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.780
How much do you know
about the murder case

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:27.980
in Chencang involving Qin Hong?

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:29.550
I read all the case reports you sent

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:30.390
before you came.

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:33.760
In that case,

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:37.280
Qin Hong killed for revenge.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.360
The victim was a major figure

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:41.670
from the crime gang in Chencang.

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:43.840
After she killed him,

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:46.360
Qin Hong managed to evade
the police for a year.

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:48.650
How could a woman like her

00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:51.210
possibly die at Ma Weicheng's hands?

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:57.880
I've been thinking
about this these days.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:00.320
The Lin Chang that Ma Weicheng described

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.760
is nothing

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.480
like what I would imagine.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.800
Are you suggesting
that Qin Hong is still alive?

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.360
What if it's just her way

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.880
of escaping the police?

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:30.480
Why not look at it differently?

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.710
If Qin Hong weren't dead,

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.840
why would Ma Weicheng confess

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:37.110
during interrogation?

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.280
What possible reason would he have

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.400
to take the fall for Qin Hong

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.480
at the cost of his life and freedom?

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:44.940
That's the part I can't figure out.

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:46.780
Unless

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:47.560
we were both wrong,

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:48.920
and those two really were in love.

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:49.880
Then that's possible.

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.360
Maybe it's just hard

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:07.710
for you to accept This outcome

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:08.760
right now.

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.280
You've been working on this case

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.760
for more than a year, after all.

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:16.190
You must've tried every possible way

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:17.630
and guessed every possible scenario.

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:19.550
But the result we have now

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:21.880
is completely beyond what you expected.

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.000
The suspect is dead.

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:39.440
Tomorrow,

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.280
I'll head back to Chencang

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.320
to see someone.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.640
Who?

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.120
Qin Hong's mother.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:46.800
What's wrong?

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:48.960
Are you new here?

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:52.230
Open the door.

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:53.490
Come out and fill out the form.

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:55.760
When we rent houses to outsiders,

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.550
we have to let the police know.

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:05.360
This area's pretty small.

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.550
It's for your safety.

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:21.920
You're here alone?

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:23.000
Three.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.480
Plus his wife and kid.

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:29.400
They came in too late last night.

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:30.220
Still asleep.

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:31.230
Just register me for now.

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:32.670
Register everyone staying here.

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:34.190
Let's keep it honest.

00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:35.900
If they're still asleep,
go get their IDs,

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:37.170
and let me fill out the form.

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.550
Zhang Yan.

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:02.720
(Resident Registration Form)

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:09.340
(Zhang Yan, Chen Yiting)

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:11.110
Chen Yiting.

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:15.470
Is it done?

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:17.070
Yeah.

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:18.800
We need to stay thorough with our work.

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:21.590
Alright, we'll leave now.

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:22.660
Okay, let's go.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:38.600
They're gone?

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:40.320
Yes.

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:46.540
