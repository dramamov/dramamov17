=Episode 14=

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.359
Gu Chenyu has already
found your daughter.

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:03.520
She's safe now.

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:06.079
Dad,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.879
the nurse said the surgery
can start very soon.

00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:11.519
I miss you so much.

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.200
When will you come to be with me?

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:16.959
I'm sorry.

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:22.799
I shouldn't have trusted Ms. Bai.

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.599
My daughter is turning six this year.

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:29.000
If the surgery isn't done soon,
it will be too late.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.280
I can't just stand by and watch her die.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.799
I had no choice.

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:38.280
I could only help Ms. Bai
forge the diagnosis.

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.719
In fact, that patient wasn't
suffering from food poisoning at all.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.120
He actually died
of late-stage stomach cancer.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.159
I even took money
from the patient's family.

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:58.959
We all acted out
this whole charade together.

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.159
Stop wasting words on him.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.519
He nearly ruined Jiangxing Hotel.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:04.760
Just call the police.

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.719
I beg you.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.159
Let me see my daughter one more time.

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:13.719
She's about to go into surgery.

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:15.680
I'm worried about her.

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:17.960
She's still so young.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.000
She can't be without her father.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.000
I'll take you to the police station.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.520
Consider it a voluntary surrender.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.520
Confess and get leniency.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.599
Try to get a lighter sentence.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.159
Thank you.

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:36.719
Thank you.

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:42.159
I was wrong, I was really wrong.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.120
Madam,

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.960
the child was taken by Gu Chenyu.

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:51.879
The person handling Wang Hao
is also unreachable.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.080
Things might be exposed.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.400
Mom,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.280
I need to ask you something.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.280
After I finish this drink.

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.800
I remember when I first arrived
at the Gu family,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.960
the first time I saw
this kind of liquor,

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:28.680
I couldn't help touching it.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.719
But Steward Zhao

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.159
slapped me twice hard.

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:40.960
He said it's high-end liquor.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.960
A lowly maid like me
has no right to touch it.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.080
If I damaged it,

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.560
I couldn't even repay the loss
with my life.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.479
At that moment, I swore

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.520
that one day

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.919
everything in the Gu family
would belong to me.

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.199
I would touch whatever I wanted.

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:03.560
Mom,

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.400
you're drunk.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.800
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.599
Even you look down on me?

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.720
Back then, if I hadn't fought to climb into
that short-lived man's bed,

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.879
how would you exist?

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:20.079
Everything you have now,

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.319
was fought for

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:23.199
by your mother through sheer effort.

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:24.720
I would rather have nothing.

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:27.439
The Jiangxing Hotel
food poisoning incident

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:28.560
was all your doing, wasn't it?

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:30.399
Don't you want Fu Yunyun?

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:31.600
Once you bring down Gu Chenyu,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.920
you'll have everything.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.920
But you shouldn't have
touched Jiangxing Hotel.

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:37.560
It's what Yunyun cares about most.

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:41.120
Again Yunyun.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.399
Again this Yunyun.

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:45.600
How did I end up
with such a useless son?

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.380
You don't think about how
to become head of the Gu family.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.000
Your mind is full of this woman.

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:51.720
I'm telling you now,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.319
Yunyun probably already
knows everything.

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:55.519
She has found witnesses.

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:57.800
She's about to send me to prison.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.399
Do you understand?

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:06.879
I underestimated her.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.399
I didn't expect

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:12.360
she would team up with Gu Chenyu.

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:15.800
Son,

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.360
she has already betrayed you.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.079
She chose Gu Chenyu.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.959
Why are you still so stubborn?

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.920
Now it's your turn to make a choice.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.680
Will you stand by her,

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.079
or help your mother?

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.600
Mom...

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:40.319
Bai Lanxing,

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.319
the police are almost here.

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:45.199
You can't run anymore.

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:47.199
Gu Chenyu.

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:47.480
Mom!

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.800
Why do you always ruin my plans?

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.800
If it weren't for you,

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:52.959
Yansheng would already
be head of the Gu family.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.360
You destroyed everything
that belonged to us.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.160
You…

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.240
Gu Chenyu!

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.879
Mom!

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.199
Son!

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.560
Son!

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.439
Son!

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.360
Mom.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.519
Don't

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:20.360
keep making

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:24.120
the same mistakes.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.000
You're no longer on my side.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.600
What's the point of my effort now?

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.800
Son.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.480
Mom.

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:40.759
Mom.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:41.560
Yansheng.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.720
Chenyu.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.120
Please spare Mom.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.319
No matter what she's done wrong,

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:48.279
I will bear it for her.

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:49.199
Shut up!

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:50.319
Bear what?

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:52.600
All of this is my doing.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.959
I hate you.

00:06:53.959 --> 00:06:54.920
I hate the Gu family.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.399
I hate all of you.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.160
I hate you to death!

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.199
You all deserve to die.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.480
Take Bai Lanxing away.

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:07.439
Mom.

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:07.879
Go!

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:08.639
Son!

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:09.120
Mom!

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.319
Son!

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:12.120
Mom!

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.959
Son!

00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:16.560
Chenyu.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.079
(VIP room) Are you crazy?

00:07:24.079 --> 00:07:24.600
Do you know

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.279
if this knife

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:26.279
even slightly misses,

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.319
your life would be over.

00:07:28.959 --> 00:07:30.360
How is my mother doing?

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:33.399
- Wang Hao already confessed.
- She…

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.560
The police also found
the evidence of Bai Lanxing

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.079
colluding with Steward Zhao
on her phone.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.720
Steward Zhao poisoned Grandma

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.959
under her orders.

00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:44.839
She committed a crime.

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:46.519
She must face the law.

00:07:46.519 --> 00:07:48.920
Did Mom really do all these things?

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.279
I don't believe it.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.319
How could she be this kind of person?

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.319
Everything she did was for me.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.079
She wanted me to become
head of the family so badly.

00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:03.199
I was too useless.

00:08:03.959 --> 00:08:05.079
Stop blaming yourself.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.279
She is herself,

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:09.720
and you are you.

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:14.120
No matter what,

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.759
I want to thank you today.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.680
Yansheng.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.879
Ready, march.

00:08:37.879 --> 00:08:40.600
One-one-two-one.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.200
One-two-one.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.200
How about giving this to Chenyu?

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.559
He'll definitely like it.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.720
Grandma,

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.919
Chenyu has grown up now.

00:08:49.919 --> 00:08:51.360
What are you talking about?

00:08:51.799 --> 00:08:54.919
Don't be fooled by how mature he seems.

00:08:54.919 --> 00:08:56.320
Actually,

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.080
he has his hardships.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.080
His mother died early,

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.519
and his father remarried.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.399
This stepmother

00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:07.960
gave him younger siblings.

00:09:09.879 --> 00:09:11.559
In this family,

00:09:11.559 --> 00:09:13.759
I'm the only one supporting him.

00:09:16.759 --> 00:09:18.120
Look at the time.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.279
Shouldn't Chenyu be off school by now?

00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:22.559
Go pick him up quickly.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.080
Grandma, I'm Chenyu.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.000
Don't you recognize me?

00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:30.720
Aren't you the new housekeeper here?

00:09:31.399 --> 00:09:32.000
Oh, right.

00:09:32.159 --> 00:09:33.080
On your way,

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.600
give my son a call.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.279
Tell him not to work overtime today,

00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:37.519
and come back early.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.879
And bring Lanxing,

00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:40.720
Yansheng,

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.039
and Shiqi back with you.

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:46.720
How long has it been
since this family had a meal together?

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.120
Today is my grandson's birthday.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.120
Everyone,

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.559
make sure we celebrate
properly together.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.240
Chenyu,

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.159
my little grandson.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.360
Alright.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.159
I'll listen to you, Grandma.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.799
My little baby,

00:10:08.799 --> 00:10:10.519
my little Chenyu.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Today,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.200
I'll give you a special
"little man" toy.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.879
Madam, we should go
for the check-up now.

00:10:18.559 --> 00:10:19.320
Check-up?

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.720
Yes, let's go.

00:10:22.759 --> 00:10:24.519
Off to the check-up.

00:10:24.519 --> 00:10:25.759
Let's go.

00:10:27.879 --> 00:10:29.720
One-two-one.

00:10:30.519 --> 00:10:32.799
One-two-one.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.600
Maybe one day, grandma will get better.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.480
She will remember you.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.159
Let's go home first.

00:10:52.399 --> 00:10:54.039
Do I still have a home?

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.679
You still have me.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
I'll be with you all this time.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.960
I believe Yansheng and Shiqi

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.000
will understand you one day.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.200
Then will you always stay with me?

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:16.840
I…
