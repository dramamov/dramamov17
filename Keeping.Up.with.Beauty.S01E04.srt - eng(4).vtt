00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.040
Mr. Gu.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.600
- May we have a quick interview?
- Please, come in.

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:19.519
Mr. Gu, you rarely attend public events.

00:01:19.519 --> 00:01:21.760
Your appearance today at this auction,
is there a special reason?

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.319
Mr. Gu.

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.680
Good evening, Mr. Gu.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.319
Mr. Gu.

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:26.319
Good evening, Mr. Gu.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.239
You were never interested

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.040
in events like this before.

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:52.000
People's interests can change.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.920
I may not have cared before,

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:56.239
but maybe I do now.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.159
Then I wish you

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.040
a pleasant time bidding later.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.280
But

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:05.200
if you happen to like
the same thing I do,

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:08.199
I won't hold back just because

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:09.840
you're my brother.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.840
Same here.

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:17.039
Zhao Muyan is here.

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.560
Zhao Muyan?

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.240
Look, it's Zhao Muyan's car!

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.120
Why is he here too?

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.759
Muyan's here! Let's go!

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.039
- Muyan!
- Muyan!

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.599
Muyan, can we have a quick interview?

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:29.319
Look over here, please!

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:37.800
Who's that woman with him?

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.479
Mr. Zhao, you've kept
a low profile recently.

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:41.919
Your high-profile appearance today,

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:42.680
does it mean

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.280
you have a new project coming soon?

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.479
She's so beautiful.

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:58.800
Mr. Zhao, please explain!

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.759
Is she your girlfriend?

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:06.759
Is she your girlfriend?

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:08.000
How long have you two been together?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.159
How far have you progressed?

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:10.520
When will you make it public?

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:17.520
Excuse me.

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.039
Mr. Zhao.

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.960
Mr. Zhao!

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.240
Isn't that Fu Yunyun?

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.680
Hello.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.039
How did she become his girlfriend?

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.919
Didn't the Fu family go bankrupt?

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.000
How does she even qualify to be here?

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.319
I heard

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:44.800
she's been pestering Gu Chenyu,

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.360
and she's had something
going on with Gu Yansheng too.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.520
All she wants is to become
the future matron of the Gu family.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.280
A fallen socialite like her,
how could she dream of that?

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:54.879
She's just chasing after cold hearts.

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:56.599
The Gu family is way out of her reach.

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:58.360
So she switched her target.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.599
Careful.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.039
Thank you, everyone.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.480
Do you know each other?

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.480
No.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.360
Just two strangers.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.759
Let's grab something to eat.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.439
Sure.

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:49.639
What on earth are you doing?

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.160
You said it yourself,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.360
you don't want
our relationship public yet.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.279
I completely agree.

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:59.240
So today, we'll just pretend
we don't know each other.

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:01.439
I won't even glance your way.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.079
Are you close with that celebrity?

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.199
Sort of.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.879
We only met recently,

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:11.079
but he seems like a decent guy.

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:12.920
Righteous and kind.

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:14.600
And quick on his feet.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.480
Play all you want,

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:19.240
but don't forget who you are.

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:20.040
I know.

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:20.959
Don't worry.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.600
Out here, I'm a single woman.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.040
Nothing to do with you.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.319
And certainly nothing

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:28.160
that would affect your reputation.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.700
(Command)

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:41.079
Goodbye.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.279
Yunyun.

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:45.199
What are you looking at?

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:46.439
That.

00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:50.000
You want this?

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:54.000
Starting bid, one and a half million.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.920
I can probably manage
around three million.

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:57.160
That should be enough, right?

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:57.959
It's fine.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.399
I'll bid for you.

00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:01.000
I'll cover anything over that.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.800
No need.

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:03.040
Consider it a loan.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.920
At worst,

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.319
you can pay me back slowly.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.959
(Best if you never pay it back.)

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:20.120
Then I'll count on you.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.439
This item means a lot to me.

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:23.240
I must have it no matter what.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.519
Understood.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.000
Thank you.

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:29.800
Dear guests,

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.240
the auction is about to begin.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.800
Please take your seats.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.120
(The Gilded Enamel Jade Command Command of Great Liang)
Next, item number twenty-seven.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.319
A general's command token
from the Great Liang dynasty,

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:42.199
dating back over a thousand years.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.160
Legend has it

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.360
(Command)
belonged to a family of loyal generals,

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.920
each generation sacrificing their lives

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.879
for the nation.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.800
It carries extraordinary meaning.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.639
Moreover,

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:54.480
it was crafted using a mysterious
material long lost to history.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.000
Even after a millennium,
it shows no sign of decay.

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:59.639
It holds immense historical
and research value.

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:00.639
Starting bid with

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:02.199
one and a half million.

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:03.680
The bidding begins now.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.920

Bidder 006, one and a half million.

Bidder 012, two million.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.000
Three million.

Four million.

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:17.839
What's gotten into him?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.600
Five million.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.920
Six million.

00:07:24.519 --> 00:07:25.160
Eight million.

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:27.399
Bidder 006, eight million.

00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:28.759
That much?

00:07:29.519 --> 00:07:30.480
Ten million.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.040
Ten million.

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:35.920
Bidder 012, ten million.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.519
From one and a half million
to ten million,

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.920
impressive spending indeed.

00:07:42.439 --> 00:07:45.120
Bidder 012, ten million once.

00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:46.160
Twelve million.

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:48.199
I can still raise it.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.120
But I can't afford it.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.519
Impossible.

00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:53.920
Ten million, twice.

00:07:56.879 --> 00:07:57.639
(Forget it.)

00:07:58.279 --> 00:08:00.079
(I'll just go home
and beat up Gu Yansheng,)

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.560
(and steal the token back.)

00:08:04.199 --> 00:08:05.279
Ten million, third...

00:08:05.439 --> 00:08:06.160
Twenty million!

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.199
Twenty million!

00:08:10.839 --> 00:08:12.519
The Gu family really is loaded.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.439
Bidder 003, twenty million once.

00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:22.040
Twenty million, twice.

00:08:26.079 --> 00:08:27.959
Twenty million, third call.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.720
Congratulations to Bidder 003

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.480
for winning the Millennium
Gilded General's Command.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:36.519
It's all right.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.159
I'll think of another way.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.020
(Command)

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.440
Next up is item number twenty-eight.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.279
Why did you stop me from bidding?

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.600
Twenty million,

00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:55.080
I can do that too.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.080
You could, but I couldn't pay it back.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.000
Anyway,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.360
thank you for today.

00:09:03.639 --> 00:09:05.399
A thank you isn't enough.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.759
At least buy me dinner.

00:09:08.799 --> 00:09:09.720
How about

00:09:10.039 --> 00:09:11.399
we exchange contacts?

00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:13.000
Sure.

00:09:22.639 --> 00:09:23.200
Done.

00:09:23.559 --> 00:09:24.879
From now on we're WeChat friends,

00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:26.679
QQ friends, Feishu friends,
and DingTalk friends.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:27.600
Oh, right.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.240
Press one to call me directly.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.279
That quick?

00:09:32.519 --> 00:09:33.720
If you're ever confused,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:34.960
contact me anytime.

00:09:35.639 --> 00:09:36.519
As a friend,
