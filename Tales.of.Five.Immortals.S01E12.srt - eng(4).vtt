00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.519
Laifu

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:16.920
What are you doing in my room, Laifu?

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.640
What are you doing?

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.040
What did you do to me last night?

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:24.599
Speak!

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:27.680
Miss Bai, I must say...

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:29.920
Perhaps you should look at yourself first.

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:31.599
Your clothes are perfectly neat from head to toe.

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:32.879
What could I possibly have done?

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.040
I...

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:37.400
I should be asking you!

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.519
You held me so tightly...

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:40.120
What were you trying to do?

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:42.840
I held you?

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.879
How could I possibly have held you?

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.840
Even if... even if I did hold you...

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.359
Don't you have your own room?

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.879
Couldn't you have walked back yourself?

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.920
You held me so tightly...

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.959
How could I move?

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.480
I...

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.079
I held you that tightly?

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.799
I...

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:02.959
Miss, Officer Gu is here to see Young Master Laifu.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.280
The young master isn't in his room.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.840
Understood.

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:09.719
You had her come looking for you again?

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.280
This time it really wasn't me.

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:14.800
There was a murder here last night.

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:16.639
Though it's already been closed - not by me.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.319
But...

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.319
I suspect it's related to the Serpent Immortal.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.919
Master Bai isn't here.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.400
So we must ask you, the new head, to help.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.080
Wasn't it already closed?

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.719
That's the official conclusion.

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:34.599
But personally, I believe...

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.759
Someone must be...

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:39.800
...using the immortal's name to commit crimes.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.520
Crime scene.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.039
Unauthorized personnel, don't touch anything.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.800
Step aside.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.560
Let's go, this way.

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:21.879
The deceased is named Gao Shan.

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.000
When we found him...

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.039
...he was curled up completely.

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.159
His skin was festering...

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.800
His entire body...

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.560
...as if hiding from something.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.240
Where was the body found?

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.639
Cause of death?

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.680
Asphyxiation.

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.639
No signs of forced entry.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.719
Orders from above...

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:51.319
...to rule it a suicide.

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.840
Suicide?

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.120
In that condition...

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.520
...and they call it suicide?

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.520
Your police work is quite lax, isn't it?

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.039
What?

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.039
That's why I must investigate personally.

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.800
Officer Gu...

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:07.840
Did he have any family or friends?

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:10.280
His wife died in childbirth.

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:12.280
His only son...

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:14.439
...drowned three days ago.

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.839
After his son's death...

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.639
...strange things occurred.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:22.839
Strange things?

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.199
At Heixiazi Mountain outside town...

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:26.600
...there's an abandoned mansion.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.040
Rumored to revive the dead and cure all ills.

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:32.040
Gao Shan took his child there.

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:41.560
Master Wei, save my child!

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.839
Master Wei!

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:44.160
Master Wei!

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.720
Please, save my child!

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.879
Master Wei!

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.240
I beg you, save my child!

00:04:56.079 --> 00:04:56.800
Chang'an.

00:04:58.319 --> 00:04:59.240
Go see.

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.920
Yes.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.319
The dead cannot return.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.839
Yet this Master claims there's a way.

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:16.519
Only this method...

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:35.000
The dead cannot return to life.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.399
This believer, please return.

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:38.279
Master Wei

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.040
He's my only child.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.240
I'll give you all my possessions.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.439
It's not about money.

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:46.680
Life and death are fated.

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:48.600
To defy heaven's will...

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:50.639
brings calamity.

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:53.519
Please, save my child.

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:54.879
Please help me.

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:56.480
Save my child.

00:05:58.319 --> 00:05:59.839
There is a way...

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.920
but it requires your lifespan.

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:05.959
Agreeable?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.120
If it saves my child,

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:08.800
I'll do anything.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.639
To save all from suffering

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.920
is my sacred duty.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.680
Heaven has its ways,

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.319
earth its spirits.

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:30.079
Yin yang displaced,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.120
fate overturned.

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:35.920
This life for that life.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.600
Folklore says

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.800
snakes bridge worlds.

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:56.120
They say Master Wei

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.800
commands snakes to steal life.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.040
Dawa, you're awake.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:37.680
Listen.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.720
Chant this all the way home:

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:43.560
"Departed soul, swiftly return."

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:44.920
Remember:

00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:46.439
Before reaching home,

00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:48.199
no matter what happens

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.040
or what you hear,

00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:52.120
never look back.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.639
This is vital.

00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:54.920
Understood.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.199
I know.

00:07:57.639 --> 00:07:59.319
"Departed soul, swiftly return."

00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:01.439
"Departed soul, swiftly return."

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.439
"Departed soul, swiftly return."

00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:07.839
"Departed soul, swiftly return."

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:10.480
"Departed soul, swiftly return."

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.800
"Departed soul, swiftly return."

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:13.639
Father...

00:08:14.519 --> 00:08:15.720
I'm cold.

00:08:19.519 --> 00:08:20.399
Can't look back.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.160
"Departed soul, swiftly return."

00:08:23.439 --> 00:08:25.160
Father... "Departed soul..."

00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:26.680
I'm tired.

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:29.519
Just rest... no looking back.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.959
"Departed soul..." Father...

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:32.679
Father!

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.159
Father! Help! "Departed..."

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.080
They're taking me!

00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:37.440
Father!

00:08:38.879 --> 00:08:39.480
Dawa!

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:41.440
Dawa!

00:08:46.879 --> 00:08:47.480
Father!

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.480
Father!

00:08:49.039 --> 00:08:49.879
Father! I'm scared!

00:08:50.399 --> 00:08:51.960
Quick! Take me home!

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:52.600
Father!

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.039
Soon after returning,

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.000
Gaoshan died.

00:08:59.559 --> 00:09:00.799
In our Northeast,

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.399
snakes becoming immortals

00:09:05.799 --> 00:09:08.960
are called Serpent Immortals.

00:09:10.799 --> 00:09:12.159
Those who commune with them

00:09:12.279 --> 00:09:13.279
are Shamans.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.279
But

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.159
we've never heard

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.120
of raising the dead.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.519
To learn Master Wei's tricks,

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.120
let's investigate.

00:09:25.799 --> 00:09:26.960
I know the location.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.240
Wait.

00:09:29.919 --> 00:09:31.679
Going directly is too obvious.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.759
We'll be spotted.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:33.840
What's our cover?

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.600
I've got it.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.159
Master Wei "cures all ills," right?

00:09:39.759 --> 00:09:41.600
Someone can fake illness.

00:09:42.039 --> 00:09:42.679
Fake illness?

00:09:43.559 --> 00:09:44.399
Who'll do it?

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.799
I serve the Serpent Immortal,

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.840
blessed with power

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:07.200
to cure all ailments

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.039
and ease worldly pains.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.440
May your hearts be kind.

00:11:23.399 --> 00:11:24.840
Gaoshan attended this gathering.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.960
Master Wei's words

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.519
sound convincing.

00:11:29.879 --> 00:11:30.919
Don't listen to his words,

00:11:31.879 --> 00:11:32.840
watch his actions.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:34.600
Right.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:51.799
My leg is healed.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.200
Even a decade-old ailment can be cured.

00:11:54.519 --> 00:11:55.639
I can stand up.

00:11:56.879 --> 00:11:57.440
I can stand up.

00:11:57.559 --> 00:11:58.759
The Great Immortal has manifested!

00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:02.679
The Great Immortal has manifested!

00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:04.519
The Great Immortal has manifested!

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.519
The Great Immortal has manifested!

00:12:07.039 --> 00:12:08.399
The Great Immortal has manifested!

00:12:08.919 --> 00:12:09.720
The Great Immortal has manifested!

00:12:09.879 --> 00:12:11.759
Bless us, Great Immortal.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.360
Master Wei.

00:12:14.159 --> 00:12:14.799
Master Wei.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.279
Young man,

00:12:19.559 --> 00:12:21.200
this is your first time here, right?

00:12:22.559 --> 00:12:23.240
No worries.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.080
You're now one of us.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.080
Master Wei.

00:12:27.799 --> 00:12:29.919
My husband has been sickly since childhood.

00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:31.720
It's been so long.

00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:33.320
Could you please examine him?

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.519
Master Wei can only heal one person per day.

00:12:36.879 --> 00:12:38.039
If you seek treatment,

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.360
you must wait.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.399
How long must we wait?

00:12:42.559 --> 00:12:44.159
If there's a chance,

00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:45.399
you'll get your turn.

00:12:46.919 --> 00:12:49.000
No, we truly can't wait any longer.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.159
Let's go.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.320
My mother is gravely ill.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.960
The doctor says she won't last long.

00:13:19.679 --> 00:13:21.720
Please, have mercy and save my mother.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.679
I've brought money - all the money.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.240
I've said it many times,

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:29.279
your case isn't about money.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.399
As the saying goes, life and death are fated.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.279
If I arrange treatment for you early,

00:13:36.679 --> 00:13:37.840
it might affect

00:13:37.879 --> 00:13:39.919
other devotees' lives.

00:13:41.039 --> 00:13:42.000
I... I...

00:13:42.039 --> 00:13:44.480
You should wait in line.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.279
I know this is wrong,

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.919
but I must save my mother.

00:13:50.519 --> 00:13:52.320
We only have each other.

00:13:52.559 --> 00:13:53.519
If she dies,

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.200
I can't go on living.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.200
Master Wei, I beg you.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.639
Please save my mother.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.919
I beg you, Master Wei.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.360
I beg you.

00:14:03.879 --> 00:14:04.279
I beg you.

00:14:04.279 --> 00:14:05.559
Come back later.
