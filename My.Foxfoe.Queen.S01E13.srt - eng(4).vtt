00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.699
Can the Empress's illness

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.260
ever be cured?

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.380
Your Majesty.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.419
Her Highness has long suffered
from a lung condition.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.539
Today, the pollen triggered an attack,

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.059
causing her lungs to rupture.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.459
She's coughed up all the vital blood

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.939
that was keeping her alive.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.859
Now her yin and yang are divided.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.820
I fear

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.180
nothing can save her anymore.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.700
The Imperial Medical Court is
full of useless fools!

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.339
The Empress is on the brink of death,

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.179
and you still have no cure?

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.859
Please, calm down, Your Majesty.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.859
We...

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.979
We need time to study the ancient texts.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.539
Perhaps we can find a similar case.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.260
And can the Empress wait that long?

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.140
Listen carefully.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.580
By tomorrow morning,
you will find a solution.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.860
If you fail, I'll have
all your families executed.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.419
Yes.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.740
Your Majesty.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.539
Your Lordship.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.179
I have terrible news.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.659
The Empress suddenly collapsed.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.939
She coughed up a lot of blood.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.380
She might not make it.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.180
What?

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.779
(It seems the blood I gave her)

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.419
(has been coughed out.)

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.379
(She's only holding on
by a sliver of her soul.)

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.460
(It won't be long
before it fades completely.)

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.260
(I have to find a way
to give her my blood again.)

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.459
The physician will
reexamine Her Highness.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.339
You may all leave.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.540
Yes.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.060
His Majesty could arrive at any moment.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.740
Please be careful, Your Lordship.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.940
Yue.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.140
I'm sorry.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.739
Chicken.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.940
What?

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.019
I want to eat chicken.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.099
Sure.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.380
When you get better,

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.740
I'll get you
every chicken in the capital.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.660
You can eat as much as you want.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.820
How is the Empress?

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.780
Your Majesty.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.180
Given her condition,

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.859
her yang energy is overflowing,

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.500
and her yin has completely faded.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.700
I've gone through every medical text,

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.140
and if Your Majesty,
who carries pure yang,

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.900
gathers water of pure yin
beneath the moonlight

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.140
and feeds it to her,

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.499
her condition might improve.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.780
What do you mean?

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.179
Your Majesty must go outside right now,

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.219
and collect the dew yourself.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.340
Very well.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.500
I shall go at once.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:23.619
Yue.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.099
No matter what happens,

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.700
I'll protect you
for the rest of my life.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.620
Yue.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.140
No matter what happens,

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.780
I'll always keep you safe.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.300
Yaya.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.540
Yaya.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.060
Why are you here?

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.139
Wasn't it His Majesty

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.740
you loved?

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.700
Why are you clinging to me now?

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.580
You two just look too much alike.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.939
I was sick, my sight were blurry.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.620
I didn't get a clear look.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.020
Liar.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.260
But look at the two of you.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.859
Even your builds are identical.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.579
I bet these muscles

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.220
feel exactly the same too.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.019
(After all those kisses,)

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.980
(you should've opened up by now.)

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.380
Don't believe me? Let me feel.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.140
Why won't you let me touch you?

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.740
In your eyes,

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.260
am I just a replacement?

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.819
There are boundaries.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.420
We shouldn't meet again.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.180
This man is just

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.140
moody, unpredictable,

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.540
and such a pervert.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.380
What a creep.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.740
That hurts.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.180
Your Majesty.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.500
It's already dawn.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.899
Find out who that useless physician is.
Wipe out his whole family.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:30.700
Yes.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.940
Your Lordship, you called for me?

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.620
Is this for the Empress?

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.380
Wait.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.980
She can't know it's from me.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:04.820
Understood.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.700
Not bad.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.100
I knew you liked to eat.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.259
But I didn't expect you
to eat this much.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:24.859
Hey, Liusu.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:25.819
Listen up.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.219
Last night, I dreamt
I was eating chicken,

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.579
and now, I actually got to eat it.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:30.099
How nice.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.100
Thank you.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:32.819
Thank me?

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.340
It wasn't from me.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.940
As long as you're happy,
that's what matters.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.380
By the way, Your Highness.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.259
So,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.179
you've almost fully recovered now.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.740
What if His Majesty wants to
share your chambers again?

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.659
What else can I do?

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.220
I'll just have to keep pretending.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.419
But with an appetite like that,

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.340
you don't look sick at all.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:56.539
- You little...
- Your Majesty!

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.780
Keep your voice down.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.300
Don't wake the Empress.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:00.860
Take this.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.340
Is the Empress awake?

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:12.699
Your Majesty.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.380
Her Highness is still unconscious.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.019
These are her favorite roast chickens.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.100
I was hoping the smell might wake her.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.219
Your Majesty.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.179
Her pulse is steady and strong.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.419
Her body seems to be recovering.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.180
Then, why hasn't she woken up?

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:53.739
I...

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.140
Don't try to fool me.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.099
I'll think twice

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.380
before believing another physician.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.019
Last night, you said
you had no solution.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.219
And now, after one night,

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.380
she is fine?

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.219
You even made me
collect dew under the moon.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.300
I stood outside like a fool all night.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.099
(This pulse...)

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.220
(The Empress should've woken by now.)

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.620
What is going on now?

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.380
(I'll just say whatever saves my life.)

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:21.579
Your Majesty.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.419
Her Highness will wake up by tomorrow.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.540
Good.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.380
If she doesn't,

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.099
you know what awaits you.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.219
I understand, Your Majesty.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.180
You may leave.

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:31.500
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.459
If there's any change in her condition,

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:35.940
report to me immediately.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.620
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:52.580
So hot.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.300
Wait a second.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.619
Last night, I was still gravely ill.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.340
How am I suddenly fine today?

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.140
Because...

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:06.859
Lord Wing

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.500
gave you his heart's blood to drink.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.819
What?

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:12.899
His heart's blood?

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.020
Mm-hmm.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.259
(That means)

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.220
(his icy cold heart)

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.260
(has finally opened up.)
