00:00:13.525 --> 00:00:16.587
=Episode 1=

00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:23.700
(Xiling Kingdom Palace)

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.350
(Xiling Kingdom's Lord Wing,
Xiling Xuan)

00:01:02.725 --> 00:01:07.420
(Xiling Kingdom's Empress, Jiang Xin'er)

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.540
Go.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.740
Invite His Majesty to bathe with me.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.340
Yes, Your Highness.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.220
Your Highness?

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.940
Your Highness?

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.620
You're not her.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.820
I…

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.070
(Xiling Kingdom's King, Xiling Heng)

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.060
Your Majesty.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.499
Your Majesty.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.059
I was bathing.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.660
He suddenly jumped into the pool
and tried to bathe with me.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.499
Such humiliation,

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.060
I'd rather die.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.900
Your Majesty.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.980
I was chasing a fox demon.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.780
I caught it in the pool,

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.740
but when I surfaced,
it had taken her form.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.220
Please, investigate clearly.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.219
The Empress and I were newly wed.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.660
We haven't shared a bed yet.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.860
If you like her,

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.340
she can accompany you tonight.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.099
You jest, Your Majesty.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.260
I wouldn't dare.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.260
Your Majesty.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.460
Don't worry.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.060
No one will know.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.620
Your Majesty.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.220
I chased the demon here

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.420
and bumped into her by accident.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.140
Please punish me.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.140
If it's a misunderstanding,

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.860
why would I punish you?

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.619
Here, wear this.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.140
Don't catch a cold.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.660
I can't wear your dragon robe.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.340
I'll take my leave.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.420
There's another demon.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.740
Yue! Run!

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.340
There seems to be a fox demon
in the palace.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.419
Please,

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.620
be cautious.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.140
Did he do anything to you?

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.340
No.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.419
Nothing.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.580
Good.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.980
You belong to me.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.060
No one else may touch you.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.780
(I came from Mount Yao)

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.100
(My fox clan never harmed humans.)

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.980
(Two days ago,)

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.139
(we were slaughtered by Xiling Xuan)

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.580
(to the last one.)

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.339
(My family and friends)

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.820
(all died by his hand.)

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.580
(He dug out my inner core)

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.380
(and I reverted to fox form,)

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.980
(my soul was about to fade away.)

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.580
(But Heaven had mercy,)

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.420
(the holy water of the fox clan
saved my soul.)

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.180
(Looking at the corpses of my kin,)

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.780
(I realized)

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.420
(I am the last survivor of Mount Yao.)

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.340
(I must avenge my clan.)

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.580
(Xiling Xuan.)

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.020
(I, Tushan Yue)

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.700
(will tear you to pieces)

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.220
(for my people's revenge.)

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:27.980
Fox demon!

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.660
I will catch you!

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.660
(Five petals)

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.500
(mean I can only
use my power five times.)

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.180
(After that,)

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.580
(my soul will vanish.)

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.580
(Before that,)

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.060
(I must kill Xiling Xuan.)

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.579
Your Higness.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.060
Lord Wing seeks audience.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:04.980
Let him in.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.220
Yes.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.379
Lord Wing.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.899
What brings you here so early?

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.660
I was rude last night and startled you.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.980
I came today to apologize.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.460
Please accept these gifts.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:39.979
We're family,

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.780
no need to be so formal.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:54.659
Yue.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.820
This lip balm color suits you perfectly.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:02.459
Yue.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.500
These roasted drumsticks are all yours.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:14.219
Yue.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.699
I've just brewed lots of plum wine.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.180
Come taste it with me.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.020
(It's them.)

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.580
Does Your Highness
not like these furs?

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.660
I'm not interested in furs.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.260
But haven't you always loved them?

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.220
Why the change now?

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.100
It's not that I dislike them.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.620
It's just that it's midsummer,

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.659
they're a bit too heavy and warm.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.780
Then why were you crying just now?

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.139
Because it was only
a small misunderstanding

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.820
between us.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.939
Yet you sent such precious gifts.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.020
I was truly touched.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.299
Put them away quickly.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.179
We can wear them in winter.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.500
Yes, Your Highness.

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.860
These three are just ordinary quality.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:28.300
Tonight when I execute
the other fox demon,

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.700
I'll skin its pelt

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.020
and bring it to you.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.699
You mean,
there's still one fox demon alive?

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:39.820
Yes.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.259
That fox has fiery red fur,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.860
especially bright in color.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.019
I believe

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.379
you'll surely like it.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.620
(Fiery-red fur…)

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.380
Yue!

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.980
Run!

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:55.860
(It's Tongtong.)

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.339
Where is she now?

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.739
You may not know,

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.339
but every captured demon

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.380
is imprisoned deep beneath the palace,
in the Soul-Suppressing Prison.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.780
Would you like to come see it with me?

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.099
I'd like to,

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.700
but knowing it's a demon,

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.420
I feel a bit afraid.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:17.980
Better not.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:19.979
Very well.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.700
Then I'll take my leave.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.979
Once I've skinned it,

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.420
I'll bring the fur to you.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:26.780
Mm.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.780
(I can't let another clansman be killed.)

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.220
(I must rescue Tongtong.)

00:11:46.687 --> 00:11:52.420
(Soul-Suppressing Prison)

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:12.500
(My powers won't work here.)

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.980
(No wonder they lock demons
in this place.)

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.700
(There's a barrier!)

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:19.580
(Whatever it takes,)

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.380
(I must save Tongtong first)

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:33.860
(Tongtong.)

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:50.980
It's you.
