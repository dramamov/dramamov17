00:01:49.084 --> 00:01:50.164
(What's going on?)

00:01:51.324 --> 00:01:52.563
Your Honor!

00:01:52.763 --> 00:01:54.123
You must uphold justice for us.

00:01:54.403 --> 00:01:55.283
Look at this bride

00:01:55.444 --> 00:01:56.324
and her adulterer.

00:01:56.643 --> 00:01:57.763
She didn't come to marry,

00:01:57.763 --> 00:02:00.324
but to wipe out our family.

00:02:00.804 --> 00:02:01.363
Mr. Xue.

00:02:01.363 --> 00:02:02.164
Get up first.

00:02:02.244 --> 00:02:02.884
Calm down.

00:02:03.444 --> 00:02:04.604
I can't calm down, my lord.

00:02:05.003 --> 00:02:06.684
My father was supposed to be remarried.

00:02:06.884 --> 00:02:07.763
However,

00:02:07.763 --> 00:02:09.480
the bride and her adulterer tried

00:02:09.724 --> 00:02:11.203
to murder my father this morning.

00:02:12.284 --> 00:02:12.923
My son.

00:02:13.643 --> 00:02:16.164
Why can't you accept me
as your stepmother?

00:02:16.164 --> 00:02:18.523
Why would you frame me
with such a heinous crime?

00:02:19.164 --> 00:02:20.284
Frame you?

00:02:21.284 --> 00:02:21.763
This is

00:02:22.376 --> 00:02:24.284
what I found in my father's bedroom.

00:02:24.604 --> 00:02:26.763
It's the same fabric
this adulterer is wearing.

00:02:26.963 --> 00:02:28.203
He is the culprit.

00:02:38.284 --> 00:02:39.284
Who's the adulterer?

00:02:40.363 --> 00:02:41.363
Explain yourself!

00:02:42.643 --> 00:02:44.083
Who'd be her adulterer?

00:02:45.672 --> 00:02:46.724
Look how she beat me up.

00:02:57.044 --> 00:02:58.844
Why are you carrying so many weapons?

00:03:03.592 --> 00:03:04.044
My lord.

00:03:04.243 --> 00:03:05.164
He obviously

00:03:05.444 --> 00:03:06.363
means to kill us all.

00:03:06.564 --> 00:03:07.884
Please do us justice.

00:03:08.164 --> 00:03:09.243
Nonsense...!

00:03:09.763 --> 00:03:10.324
Feng Zuoren.

00:03:10.844 --> 00:03:12.083
Say something.

00:03:12.488 --> 00:03:13.444
Idiot.

00:03:17.324 --> 00:03:18.324
At this point,

00:03:19.083 --> 00:03:19.683
Mr. Gu.

00:03:20.523 --> 00:03:21.763
Just tell them the truth.

00:03:26.803 --> 00:03:27.564
(Gu Qianfu.)

00:03:27.884 --> 00:03:29.192
(You'll have to take the fall.)

00:03:34.243 --> 00:03:36.776
How dare you?

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:38.724
I came here

00:03:39.083 --> 00:03:41.604
under imperial orders.

00:03:42.203 --> 00:03:43.324
Imperial orders?

00:03:45.404 --> 00:03:46.203
Then

00:03:47.083 --> 00:03:48.444
what's your mission?

00:03:50.884 --> 00:03:51.604
No comment.

00:03:51.604 --> 00:03:52.203
You...

00:03:52.404 --> 00:03:53.923
Why don't you stop lying?

00:03:54.363 --> 00:03:55.124
You...

00:03:55.284 --> 00:03:56.604
No comment.

00:03:56.803 --> 00:03:57.832
How dare you!

00:03:57.864 --> 00:03:59.048
You have anything to say

00:03:59.048 --> 00:03:59.923
besides "no comment"?

00:04:00.324 --> 00:04:01.604
Pathetic vocabulary.

00:04:01.803 --> 00:04:03.284
Your disrespect doubles your crime.

00:04:03.284 --> 00:04:03.844
You'd better

00:04:03.884 --> 00:04:05.083
stop making excuses.

00:04:05.243 --> 00:04:06.404
Confess and beg

00:04:06.643 --> 00:04:07.464
for forgiveness.

00:04:08.243 --> 00:04:09.004
Mr. Gu

00:04:10.803 --> 00:04:12.404
is the Chief of the Jing'an Bureau.

00:04:17.204 --> 00:04:17.764
That's right.

00:04:18.164 --> 00:04:19.844
His Majesty told me that the Xue family

00:04:20.404 --> 00:04:21.764
boasts military merits.

00:04:21.844 --> 00:04:23.003
Lord Dingyuan is ill.

00:04:23.683 --> 00:04:25.923
Many schemers would try to hurt him

00:04:26.044 --> 00:04:26.923
when he's vulnerable.

00:04:27.123 --> 00:04:29.923
Thus, Grand Tutor Zhou's Jing'an Bureau

00:04:30.123 --> 00:04:31.204
sent a special guard.

00:04:31.483 --> 00:04:32.044
And that is

00:04:33.204 --> 00:04:34.284
Mr. Gu.

00:04:39.923 --> 00:04:40.524
That's right.

00:04:40.883 --> 00:04:41.644
I almost

00:04:42.563 --> 00:04:44.123
got abducted by that culprit.

00:04:44.604 --> 00:04:46.164
Mr. Gu saved me.

00:04:46.764 --> 00:04:47.724
During the struggle,

00:04:47.964 --> 00:04:50.164
I accidentally fell onto him.

00:04:50.404 --> 00:04:51.604
That's all.

00:04:52.284 --> 00:04:53.204
I don't know

00:04:53.683 --> 00:04:54.683
anything else.

00:04:55.404 --> 00:04:57.363
If you doubt Mr. Gu's credentials,

00:04:57.844 --> 00:04:59.404
ask the Grand Tutor.

00:04:59.923 --> 00:05:00.524
All of it

00:05:00.644 --> 00:05:02.243
is arranged by the Grand Tutor.

00:05:02.724 --> 00:05:03.563
That's right.

00:05:04.604 --> 00:05:05.164
My lord.

00:05:05.644 --> 00:05:07.443
This woman has a sharp tongue.

00:05:07.604 --> 00:05:08.604
Don't be deceived.

00:05:09.604 --> 00:05:11.724
Ms. Wang just married your father.

00:05:12.644 --> 00:05:13.964
You keep opposing her

00:05:14.724 --> 00:05:16.964
and almost spread rumors about her.

00:05:17.604 --> 00:05:18.803
Your father's remarriage

00:05:19.923 --> 00:05:21.443
upsets you so much?

00:05:21.864 --> 00:05:22.404
I...

00:05:24.524 --> 00:05:26.003
How can a Xiao family member

00:05:26.084 --> 00:05:28.204
be so petty?

00:05:28.644 --> 00:05:29.003
You...

00:05:29.044 --> 00:05:29.724
Madam.

00:05:31.964 --> 00:05:33.044
Don't hurt Hexu.

00:05:37.404 --> 00:05:38.084
My son.

00:05:39.883 --> 00:05:40.844
I know you lost

00:05:41.644 --> 00:05:42.883
your mother young.

00:05:43.404 --> 00:05:45.724
Your grandmother and father raised you.

00:05:46.363 --> 00:05:47.724
That's why you're so guarded

00:05:48.136 --> 00:05:49.844
and always expecting the worst.

00:05:51.123 --> 00:05:51.844
But I know

00:05:52.084 --> 00:05:53.724
you meant to protect your family.

00:05:55.524 --> 00:05:56.204
My son.

00:05:59.524 --> 00:06:00.764
You've suffered.

00:06:04.164 --> 00:06:05.123
Ms. Wang.

00:06:06.084 --> 00:06:07.443
You showed such magnanimity

00:06:07.883 --> 00:06:09.404
after suffering such humiliation.

00:06:10.524 --> 00:06:11.803
With you joining us,

00:06:12.243 --> 00:06:16.443
our family finally sees hope.

00:06:21.483 --> 00:06:22.923
It's just a misunderstanding.

00:06:24.323 --> 00:06:25.480
In that case,

00:06:25.923 --> 00:06:28.204
I'll take my leave now.

00:06:31.404 --> 00:06:32.923
Why bother me with family affairs?

00:06:35.368 --> 00:06:36.644
It's fine now.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.000
(Xue Mansion)

00:06:56.524 --> 00:06:57.204
Stepmother.

00:06:57.363 --> 00:06:58.483
This will be your chamber.

00:06:58.724 --> 00:06:59.764
It's been a long day.

00:06:59.764 --> 00:07:00.604
You must be shaken.

00:07:00.923 --> 00:07:01.923
Rest well tonight.

00:07:02.123 --> 00:07:03.803
I'll pay my respects tomorrow morning.

00:07:05.164 --> 00:07:05.844
Thank you.

00:07:17.964 --> 00:07:18.563
Come down.

00:07:30.888 --> 00:07:32.323
No need for such formalities.

00:07:38.923 --> 00:07:39.803
Why expose me?

00:07:40.243 --> 00:07:41.604
How can I fulfill my task now?

00:07:42.123 --> 00:07:42.683
Feng Zuoren.

00:07:43.003 --> 00:07:43.524
No one wants

00:07:43.604 --> 00:07:44.724
a vicious woman like you.

00:07:45.724 --> 00:07:46.923
Have you forgotten?

00:07:47.644 --> 00:07:48.964
Today is my wedding day.

00:07:49.764 --> 00:07:50.323
Y-You...

00:07:50.524 --> 00:07:51.323
"You" what?

00:07:52.044 --> 00:07:52.803
The Jing'an Bureau

00:07:52.803 --> 00:07:54.524
is always involved in shameful dealings.

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:56.164
I gave you a chance to play hero.

00:07:56.284 --> 00:07:57.084
Be grateful.

00:07:58.563 --> 00:07:59.683
You cleared my inner energy.

00:07:59.724 --> 00:08:00.923
Yet I should thank you?

00:08:01.683 --> 00:08:02.376
The Jingang Pill

00:08:02.844 --> 00:08:04.003
restores your inner energy.

00:08:04.563 --> 00:08:06.483
I want the antidote
for the Dispersing Powder.

00:08:06.483 --> 00:08:06.964
Deal.

00:08:31.524 --> 00:08:32.284
(- I knew it.
- I knew it.)

00:08:34.563 --> 00:08:35.843
I knew it.

00:08:36.884 --> 00:08:38.088
The Jingang Pill

00:08:38.884 --> 00:08:40.843
wouldn't possibly work immediately.

00:08:41.203 --> 00:08:42.284
You think I don't know?

00:08:42.524 --> 00:08:43.443
Your antidote

00:08:43.683 --> 00:08:44.923
only works temporarily, too.

00:08:45.044 --> 00:08:45.683
- Liar.
- Liar.

00:08:46.603 --> 00:08:47.083
Good.

00:08:47.843 --> 00:08:49.404
It proves we're both well-trained.

00:08:49.884 --> 00:08:50.563
In that case,

00:08:51.284 --> 00:08:52.723
we can exchange the antidotes.

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:55.284
In your dreams.

00:08:55.923 --> 00:08:57.044
It's proven that

00:08:57.443 --> 00:08:59.164
you'd kill me once you restored

00:09:00.083 --> 00:09:01.164
your inner energy.

00:09:01.843 --> 00:09:03.364
We're both depleted of inner energy.

00:09:04.164 --> 00:09:05.323
But we must solve the case.

00:09:06.124 --> 00:09:06.764
In that case,

00:09:07.164 --> 00:09:07.963
let's join forces.

00:09:08.563 --> 00:09:09.004
Come on.

00:09:09.923 --> 00:09:11.603
Tell me the clues you have.

00:09:11.843 --> 00:09:13.764
A devil like you doesn't collaborate.

00:09:17.644 --> 00:09:18.563
Don't tell me

00:09:19.284 --> 00:09:20.603
you're completely clueless.

00:09:25.603 --> 00:09:28.484
I progressed more than you did
even without inner energy.

00:09:30.644 --> 00:09:31.923
Goodbye.

00:09:47.603 --> 00:09:48.404
It's late.

00:09:48.723 --> 00:09:49.563
Go to sleep.

00:09:49.864 --> 00:09:50.843
I'm not tired.

00:09:51.644 --> 00:09:53.923
Harmony at home brings peace, you know?

00:09:54.603 --> 00:09:55.963
I just want to protect my family.

00:09:57.203 --> 00:09:58.004
Ever since Ms. Wang

00:09:58.884 --> 00:09:59.843
came here,

00:10:00.164 --> 00:10:01.352
many things have happened.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.443
She's surely involved.

00:10:03.284 --> 00:10:06.284
Don't bring the merchant's suspicion

00:10:06.284 --> 00:10:07.524
into family affairs.

00:10:07.944 --> 00:10:09.244
Thorough consideration

00:10:09.484 --> 00:10:10.484
can't be wrong.

00:10:14.124 --> 00:10:14.603
Father.

00:10:15.164 --> 00:10:15.764
Rest assured.

00:10:16.923 --> 00:10:18.203
I won't let the Xue family

00:10:18.443 --> 00:10:19.764
suffer any harm.

00:10:22.203 --> 00:10:22.644
Father.

00:10:23.284 --> 00:10:23.764
It's fine.

00:10:23.963 --> 00:10:24.644
We're safe.

00:10:34.632 --> 00:10:36.296
(Xue Mansion)

00:11:19.563 --> 00:11:20.484
(Former Crown Prince.)

00:11:21.124 --> 00:11:22.484
(With the entire family)

00:11:23.124 --> 00:11:24.484
(accompanying you to death,)

00:11:24.884 --> 00:11:26.164
(you won't be lonely.)

00:12:02.083 --> 00:12:04.936
Fire!

00:12:06.244 --> 00:12:06.963
Hurry.

00:12:15.843 --> 00:12:16.843
It must be a coincidence.

00:12:26.884 --> 00:12:29.644
Fire!

00:12:35.364 --> 00:12:38.004
Fire!

00:12:49.284 --> 00:12:50.563
Why is this happening?

00:12:51.164 --> 00:12:52.764
They put out the fire so fast!

00:12:53.644 --> 00:12:54.536
I'll save Stepmother.

00:12:59.803 --> 00:13:00.284
Stepmother.

00:13:00.484 --> 00:13:01.443
I'm here to save you.

00:13:04.803 --> 00:13:05.244
Stepmother.

00:13:05.963 --> 00:13:06.723
Are you okay?

00:13:08.203 --> 00:13:08.963
There's a fire!

00:13:10.244 --> 00:13:12.044
(I bet this vicious woman set the fire.)

00:13:15.723 --> 00:13:16.203
Stepmother.

00:13:16.683 --> 00:13:18.963
I've contained the fires elsewhere.

00:13:19.203 --> 00:13:19.923
But the flames

00:13:21.603 --> 00:13:22.683
are too fierce here.

00:13:23.044 --> 00:13:24.603
I can't control it anymore.

00:13:27.923 --> 00:13:28.484
Stepmother.

00:13:29.323 --> 00:13:30.164
The fire is deadly.

00:13:30.563 --> 00:13:31.644
See you in the next life.

00:13:41.723 --> 00:13:42.644
Is there a fire?

00:13:42.803 --> 00:13:43.443
Yeah.

00:13:48.083 --> 00:13:49.443
Thank goodness you're fine.

00:13:52.404 --> 00:13:53.764
How could I bear to be separated

00:13:54.323 --> 00:13:55.284
from my son?

00:13:57.323 --> 00:13:59.563
We're here.

00:14:14.164 --> 00:14:15.368
Don't be afraid, Stepmother.

00:14:15.884 --> 00:14:17.404
How did the mansion catch fire?

00:14:18.443 --> 00:14:20.124
This fire came raging in

00:14:20.484 --> 00:14:21.843
and was extinguished so quickly?

00:14:22.963 --> 00:14:24.484
The manor hasn't been burnt.

00:14:25.164 --> 00:14:26.484
You must be disappointed.

00:14:26.764 --> 00:14:28.364
I'm just worried.

00:14:29.764 --> 00:14:31.484
How could you think that of me?

00:14:31.963 --> 00:14:32.563
My son.

00:14:35.244 --> 00:14:35.803
Stepmother.

00:14:36.203 --> 00:14:37.404
It's all thanks to Hexu

00:14:37.683 --> 00:14:39.203
and the alarm bells he designed.

00:14:40.843 --> 00:14:41.644
Alarm bells?

00:14:44.044 --> 00:14:44.524
Yeah.

00:14:46.323 --> 00:14:47.004
We have

00:14:47.683 --> 00:14:49.203
a thread running through the walls

00:14:50.244 --> 00:14:51.524
with bells tied to it.

00:14:52.323 --> 00:14:54.164
When fire burns through the thread,

00:14:54.563 --> 00:14:55.923
the bells drop

00:14:56.404 --> 00:14:57.404
and make a sound.

00:14:58.203 --> 00:14:58.963
When we hear it,

00:14:59.443 --> 00:15:00.683
we know where the fire is.

00:15:00.843 --> 00:15:02.364
The manor is full of bells.

00:15:02.884 --> 00:15:04.764
But Hexu won't let me play with them.

00:15:05.284 --> 00:15:06.843
Those are not toys, Dongyang.

00:15:09.683 --> 00:15:10.843
That's truly

00:15:12.364 --> 00:15:13.044
impressive.

00:15:13.963 --> 00:15:15.124
(These people)

00:15:15.723 --> 00:15:17.364
(are surprisingly hard to kill.)

00:15:17.923 --> 00:15:19.244
We have experienced ten fires

00:15:19.563 --> 00:15:20.443
in 20 years.

00:15:21.284 --> 00:15:22.524
The culprits probably think

00:15:22.963 --> 00:15:25.044
that they can disguise
murders as accidents.

00:15:25.683 --> 00:15:26.203
In that way,

00:15:26.843 --> 00:15:28.764
all evidence and witnesses

00:15:29.124 --> 00:15:30.083
will be annihilated.

00:15:30.843 --> 00:15:31.364
Right?

00:15:38.164 --> 00:15:39.764
H-how would I know?

00:15:40.443 --> 00:15:41.803
I'm scared out of my wits.

00:15:43.044 --> 00:15:43.644
Totally.

00:15:44.284 --> 00:15:45.044
The arsonist

00:15:45.364 --> 00:15:47.443
thinks he has it under control.

00:15:47.923 --> 00:15:49.563
But he will end up burned.

00:15:50.323 --> 00:15:50.884
Be careful

00:15:51.603 --> 00:15:52.644
not to get

00:15:52.963 --> 00:15:54.164
scorched.

00:15:55.443 --> 00:15:56.872
Luckily, Hexu was prepared.

00:15:57.364 --> 00:15:58.364
We conduct

00:15:58.364 --> 00:16:00.284
fire drills every month.

00:16:00.484 --> 00:16:02.124
Constant practice ensures readiness.

00:16:02.603 --> 00:16:04.164
You must have been frightened again.

00:16:04.563 --> 00:16:05.803
There are things

00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:07.164
you must get used to.

00:16:07.644 --> 00:16:09.164
You'll be arranging

00:16:09.563 --> 00:16:11.004
all the drills.

00:16:16.683 --> 00:16:17.683
I'm having a headache.

00:16:18.323 --> 00:16:19.004
It's late.

00:16:19.203 --> 00:16:20.364
Go to sleep.

00:16:20.764 --> 00:16:21.563
I'll rest, too.

00:16:54.764 --> 00:16:55.524
(My son.)

00:16:56.244 --> 00:16:57.004
(A fire)

00:16:57.004 --> 00:16:58.364
(must be foolproof.)

00:16:58.963 --> 00:16:59.963
(You can stop it once.)

00:17:00.404 --> 00:17:01.484
(But can you stop it)

00:17:01.843 --> 00:17:03.164
(twice in a row?)

00:17:06.524 --> 00:17:07.240
Four Characters.

00:17:09.484 --> 00:17:11.484
I can't sleep because of the fire.

00:17:11.724 --> 00:17:12.803
I prefer playing Mahjong.

00:17:14.204 --> 00:17:15.883
Self-drawn.

00:17:19.363 --> 00:17:20.040
Six Characters.

00:17:29.803 --> 00:17:30.403
East Wind.

00:17:32.044 --> 00:17:32.524
I won.

00:17:33.204 --> 00:17:34.403
Are you serious?

00:17:34.403 --> 00:17:35.323
You won like this?

00:17:35.323 --> 00:17:36.004
He was waiting

00:17:36.204 --> 00:17:37.004
for the east wind.

00:17:37.204 --> 00:17:38.883
Dongyang's luck is heaven-sent.

00:17:56.964 --> 00:17:58.484
East wind out of nowhere?

00:18:06.244 --> 00:18:06.643
(Oh no.)

00:18:06.984 --> 00:18:07.803
(Jing'an Bureau.)

00:18:07.803 --> 00:18:08.552
(Jing'an Bureau)

00:18:16.843 --> 00:18:17.764
Feng Zuoren,

00:18:17.883 --> 00:18:19.083
how dare you set fire

00:18:19.204 --> 00:18:20.643
to obstruct my investigation?

00:18:40.444 --> 00:18:42.883
The Xue Guardians
are obviously against me.

00:18:44.163 --> 00:18:44.643
Yeah.

00:18:45.563 --> 00:18:47.403
I must report Feng Zuoren's misconduct.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.123
That's right.

00:18:52.964 --> 00:18:53.603
Stop crying.

00:18:54.244 --> 00:18:55.524
Look at you, poor thing.

00:18:58.524 --> 00:18:59.204
Do I look fine?

00:19:02.643 --> 00:19:03.444
You look alright.

00:19:12.684 --> 00:19:14.363
His Majesty is furious.

00:19:14.764 --> 00:19:17.803
You've been too conspicuous,

00:19:18.244 --> 00:19:20.363
drawing attention in just two days.

00:19:21.083 --> 00:19:23.724
The investigation
must be conducted secretly.

00:19:24.004 --> 00:19:26.643
This commotion will alert our targets.

00:19:27.163 --> 00:19:28.004
Do you confess?

00:19:28.924 --> 00:19:30.284
I acknowledge my mistake.

00:19:30.843 --> 00:19:33.204
The imperial succession
affects everything.

00:19:33.764 --> 00:19:35.123
Don't let your stupidity

00:19:35.244 --> 00:19:36.643
ruin His Majesty's plans.

00:19:40.444 --> 00:19:41.004
Are you

00:19:42.123 --> 00:19:43.363
defying the imperial decree?

00:19:47.603 --> 00:19:48.204
I heed

00:19:48.964 --> 00:19:49.643
the decree.

00:19:58.603 --> 00:20:00.284
A mere woman like you

00:20:00.603 --> 00:20:02.083
is truly useless,

00:20:02.643 --> 00:20:04.204
wasting His Majesty's trust.

00:20:04.843 --> 00:20:06.684
If you act recklessly again,

00:20:07.204 --> 00:20:09.044
you'll forfeit your pathetic life.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.528
(Xue Street)

00:20:50.044 --> 00:20:51.684
(Guess I need to lay low.)

00:20:52.284 --> 00:20:53.603
(I can't kill the elderly.)

00:20:54.004 --> 00:20:55.843
(Nor do I have to kill the women.)

00:20:56.843 --> 00:20:58.123
(Xue Hexu.)

00:20:58.803 --> 00:20:59.764
(Despicable scum.)

00:21:00.484 --> 00:21:01.964
(I'll kill you first.)

00:21:04.968 --> 00:21:07.272
(Xue Street)

00:21:09.924 --> 00:21:11.403
It's been a mess lately.

00:21:11.924 --> 00:21:13.083
Everyone is frightened.

00:21:13.363 --> 00:21:14.403
Let's make them some soup.

00:21:15.123 --> 00:21:17.004
(Perfect time to add ingredients.)

00:21:17.004 --> 00:21:18.123
Fetch me some goji berries.

00:21:18.803 --> 00:21:19.244
Alright.

00:21:30.123 --> 00:21:31.403
Where's my Cobra Pill?

00:21:33.484 --> 00:21:34.643
Man-Eating Flower Nectar?

00:21:36.603 --> 00:21:37.964
Bone-Melting Powder?

00:21:42.843 --> 00:21:44.004
Where's my money?

00:22:04.284 --> 00:22:05.363
(That's my medicine box.)

00:22:09.204 --> 00:22:09.764
Good morning.

00:22:11.284 --> 00:22:12.444
I'm disposing of dry waste.

00:22:12.883 --> 00:22:14.284
If not handled properly,

00:22:14.484 --> 00:22:15.484
it can be poisonous.

00:22:35.924 --> 00:22:37.083
(Xue Hexu.)

00:22:37.924 --> 00:22:40.964
(You need to die right now.)

00:22:45.403 --> 00:22:45.843
Stepmother.

00:22:46.083 --> 00:22:47.336
You stay indoors all day.

00:22:47.336 --> 00:22:48.444
Let's hang out.

00:22:51.724 --> 00:22:52.484
Dongyang.

00:22:53.403 --> 00:22:55.004
The recent family troubles

00:22:55.883 --> 00:22:57.403
weigh heavily on my heart.

00:22:58.323 --> 00:22:59.363
I feel helpless.

00:23:01.964 --> 00:23:02.504
Stepmother.

00:23:03.484 --> 00:23:05.524
It's been a mess these days.

00:23:05.684 --> 00:23:07.444
Grandmother forbade me from going out,

00:23:07.643 --> 00:23:09.403
but gave me lots of pocket money.

00:23:09.563 --> 00:23:10.004
Look.

00:23:11.004 --> 00:23:12.603
I can buy treats and toys.

00:23:14.444 --> 00:23:15.123
All for you.

00:23:18.524 --> 00:23:19.244
All for me?

00:23:20.724 --> 00:23:21.444
Why?

00:23:22.924 --> 00:23:24.843
Only a good person would choose

00:23:25.083 --> 00:23:26.163
to stay with us.

00:23:26.323 --> 00:23:27.123
Grandmother says

00:23:27.244 --> 00:23:28.643
good deeds bring rewards.

00:23:29.803 --> 00:23:31.843
(None of them seems evil,)

00:23:32.444 --> 00:23:34.044
(but I still have to kill the guys.)

00:23:48.843 --> 00:23:49.563
(My son.)

00:23:50.684 --> 00:23:54.284
(It will be your death anniversary
next year on this day.)

00:23:55.624 --> 00:23:57.736
(Deadly Powder)

00:24:01.924 --> 00:24:02.524
Hexu.

00:24:03.044 --> 00:24:04.643
Have some chicken soup.

00:24:17.444 --> 00:24:18.643
Nice pinwheel.

00:24:29.603 --> 00:24:30.083
Hexu.

00:24:31.083 --> 00:24:31.643
- Dongyang.
- Chicken soup.

00:24:33.403 --> 00:24:34.123
Have it now.

00:24:34.724 --> 00:24:35.123
Alright.

00:24:47.484 --> 00:24:47.964
Dongyang.

00:24:49.163 --> 00:24:50.163
Have you seen Ms. Wang?

00:24:51.083 --> 00:24:52.403
Why are you asking?

00:24:52.924 --> 00:24:54.056
Did she touch this soup?

00:24:54.284 --> 00:24:55.083
Hexu.

00:24:55.083 --> 00:24:56.403
Now you're being naughty.

00:24:56.684 --> 00:24:58.403
Stepmother just married our father.

00:24:58.563 --> 00:25:00.444
And she was terrified last night.

00:25:00.643 --> 00:25:02.403
We can't have her cook chicken soup.

00:25:02.403 --> 00:25:03.803
Jiaoqian made it for you.

00:25:05.083 --> 00:25:06.044
Jiaoqian made it?

00:25:07.123 --> 00:25:08.200
I agree that we shouldn't

00:25:08.684 --> 00:25:09.563
bother our stepmother

00:25:09.764 --> 00:25:11.004
with these trivial matters.

00:25:11.643 --> 00:25:12.803
Tell her not to

00:25:12.803 --> 00:25:14.284
go around our mansion.

00:25:14.403 --> 00:25:15.924
Let her rest forever.

00:25:26.323 --> 00:25:27.724
I'll have it after work.

00:25:29.363 --> 00:25:30.163
No.

00:25:30.484 --> 00:25:31.363
You must have it

00:25:31.563 --> 00:25:32.724
while it's hot.

00:25:32.803 --> 00:25:33.843
Besides, look.

00:25:34.123 --> 00:25:35.924
I got you the left drumstick.

00:25:36.123 --> 00:25:38.284
So meaty and so tasty.

00:25:38.603 --> 00:25:39.244
Left drumstick.

00:25:39.484 --> 00:25:40.083
It's nice.

00:25:41.363 --> 00:25:41.803
Fine.

00:25:59.204 --> 00:26:00.323
This...

00:26:00.764 --> 00:26:01.083
This...

00:26:01.524 --> 00:26:02.163
This...

00:26:02.323 --> 00:26:03.403
This...

00:26:04.363 --> 00:26:04.803
This...

00:26:05.123 --> 00:26:05.484
This...

00:26:08.044 --> 00:26:08.843
T-This soup...
