00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.960
They're out!

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.560
Finally out, take photos!

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:03.359
Muyan, is this your girlfriend?

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.000
Quick, take the shot!

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.239
Get an exclusive face shot!

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.079
Excuse us.

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:07.560
Muyan, who is this girl?

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.680
Is she your girlfriend?

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.000
Please give us an interview.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.599
Look this way!

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.480
Say something!

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.959
Muyan, say a few words!

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:17.319
Please explain.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.040
Didn't you say
you didn't want to be linked with me?

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:33.200
We're leaving.

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:34.000
Suit yourself.

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:35.280
Explain yourself!

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:38.760
So whose girlfriend is she then?

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.680
- Attack!
- Attack!

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.639
General!

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:06.840
Release!

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.159
I

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.680
will follow the General

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.800
to the end.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.100
(Command)

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.080
(I've finally found you,)

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:49.439
(General.)

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.400
If the reporters
get a photo of you today,

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:01.800
it's not on me.

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:03.400
Relax.

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:04.599
Without my permission,

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.360
no reporter dares write gossip about me.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.680
Young Master of the Gu family,

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.080
you really are impressive.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.039
(The general's token is in his hands.)

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:15.599
(Should I knock him out)

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:16.240
(and snatch it?)

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:21.040
Do you really want this?

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.120
Yes.

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:31.279
Why do you want it so much?

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.920
You went to such lengths,

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.519
even got Zhao Muyan to help you.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.040
Because it looks a lot like

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.000
something my father left me.

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:42.120
(So she's missing her father.)

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.199
Gu Chenyu,

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:45.279
can you lend it to me?

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.920
It's yours.

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:49.240
Twenty million,

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:51.360
you're just giving it to me?

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.000
I misunderstood you
about Grandma before.

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:55.600
Consider this an apology.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.120
Then I'll accept it.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.879
Everything from before,

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:01.399
let's call it even.

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:06.920
Fu Yunyun,

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:09.199
let's get a divorce.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.800
That's sudden.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.800
We only married because of Grandma.

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:15.120
This marriage

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.959
was forced from the start.

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.920
Don't worry.

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:19.360
I'll keep my word,

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.519
you'll never have to worry
about money again.

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:25.040
Leave the Gu family after this.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.639
Live the life you want.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.600
All right.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.240
Gu Chenyu,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.600
actually,

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.959
you're not a bad person.

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:37.360
Since we've met,

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.399
I'll wish you

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:39.519
all the best.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.399
May things go your way.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.639
Farewell.

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:48.680
Mr. Gu,

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.439
Butler Zhao is dead.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.399
Butler Zhao is dead?

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.720
He had a sudden heart attack in custody,

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.800
they couldn't save him.

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:59.000
I told you to look into his family,
what did you find?

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.160
You were right again.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.920
His wife took their child

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.279
back to her hometown a month ago.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.480
Opened a shop,

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.639
bought a house,

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:07.360
doesn't look like someone
in debt from gambling.

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:08.759
If anything,

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:10.240
it's like they came into money.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.959
Keep digging.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.800
Be careful.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.040
Don't let anyone notice.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.480
Got it.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.160
You be careful too.

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:19.959
No one knows what the people
behind this will do next.

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:21.439
By the way,

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:27.199
prepare a divorce agreement for me.

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:29.480
You're divorcing Miss Fu?

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.360
The Gu family
will only grow more chaotic.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.639
I don't want anyone else
dragged into this.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.680
Hear my command,

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:52.680
send me back.

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:12.240
Send me back!

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.480
Send me back!

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.480
Back!

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:26.240
Why haven't I gone back yet?

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.279
Something's missing...

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:31.560
Something's not right.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.879
Not sincere enough?

00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:52.759
Send me back!

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.560
How can I return?

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:21.300
(Command)

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.720
Where is this place?

00:08:56.559 --> 00:08:57.120
