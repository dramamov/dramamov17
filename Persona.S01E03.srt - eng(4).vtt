00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.110
You again?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.750
I've told you so many times.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.970
You can blame your dad's death

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:02.880
on whoever you want,

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.270
but it's not related to our site.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.750
He died on your site.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.520
Who else should I come to?

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.760
Alright.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.070
Go get an adult from your family.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.550
There's no one else in my family.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.470
It's just me.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.590
Then I'll tell you one last time.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.830
I don't have a single cent.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.480
Sue me wherever you want.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.800
I'm not leaving without money.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.320
Then stand here all you want.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.240
Let me remind you.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.800
Our construction site

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.760
gets pretty wild at night.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.270
Think carefully.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.480
Time for the game.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:36.710
Four of Characters.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.340
Hey.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.830
What are you doing up there?

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.110
Come down now!

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.990
Don't come any closer.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.920
Take one step and I'll jump!

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.040
What do you want?

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.200
I want my dad's compensation money.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.200
Come down first.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.240
Give me the money first.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.990
Just come down, okay?

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.960
Money first!

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.940
(Full-service arrangements)

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.200

(Qin, you'll always be
the best dad in my heart.)

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.620
(I want to be your daughter
in the next life.)

Hong.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.320
Hong.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.960
Hong!

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.880
Don't live like me.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.760

(Chencang, 2010)

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.520
Excuse me.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:20.320
Coming through.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:22.670
What are you doing?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.790
- Watch out.
- What's going on?

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:25.880
Sorry.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.030
Watch where you're going.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.010
- Thanks.
- These are for Qin Hong's store?

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:39.270
That's quite a lot.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.590
They might not sell.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:48.120
Come back here.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:05.840
Hong.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.520
Do you think this looks good on me?

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.520
Yeah.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.080
It's the latest style, really trendy.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.830
Is this my size?

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:14.760
Yeah.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.320
Okay, wrap it up for me.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.390
The green one's 220.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.790
The yellow one's 230.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.350
Just give me both for 400.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:23.190
Okay.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:27.910
Oh, you said the size was off last time.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.640
I got you a new one; have a look.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.520
Take it home and see if it fits.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.630
But my old one's at home.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.160
No worries, just bring it with you

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.240
when you come by next time.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:37.920
Careful, careful.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.700
(Tian Cai)

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.640
Hong.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.800
Coming.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.630
Next time you come, let me know.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:49.470
Sure.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.710
- The last load?
- Yeah.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:52.550
Put them here.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:54.920
Goodbye.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:55.760
- Bye.
- Come again.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.710
Why always wear that silk scarf?

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:58.690
Aren't you feeling hot?

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:00.060
No, I get cold easily.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.110
This is heavy; let me.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.400
Only six months till the Gaokao.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.510
Stop coming here.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:06.400
Go home and study.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:08.800
- Hong.
- Goodbye.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.620
I don't want to take the exam anymore.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.020
I want to run the store with you.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:13.960
You're too young to do this.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.240
Just study hard for the exam.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:16.750
You're always so tired.

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.010
I just want to give you a hand.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:20.080
Don't worry.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.400
I'm fine; just focus on your exam.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.240
Qin Hong.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:24.710
You're both here.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.230
What do you want?

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:27.070
What's up?

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.640
Your brother

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:32.400
knocked over my mannequin just now.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.240
I told him off a bit.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:34.350
Then he got all upset

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:35.990
and kicked my mannequin again.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.110
Look what he did to this.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:39.600
How am I supposed to sell it now?

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:40.520
Nonsense.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.750
How could you say
our clothes wouldn't sell?

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:43.680
Watch your tone.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.870
Du, this is nothing.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.320
Tell me the price; I'll cover it.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.640
820.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.830
820? Isn't that too much?

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.350
What are you doing?

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.400
What's your problem?

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.510
Who told you to touch him?

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:58.470
Du.

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.080
My brother ruined your clothes.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.680
I should cover your losses.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.680
But you can't rip me off, right?

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:05.800
Who's ripping you off?

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:06.640
You are.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:09.230
The wholesale price is 820.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.440
820, really?

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.590
Maybe I should introduce
my supplier to you.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:13.920
Your wholesale price is 820,

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.700
and you're adding profit
before selling it.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.360
Isn't that misleading your customers?

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.280
That's insulting.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.460
You're insulting me here?

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:20.470
That's not what I meant.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:21.870
If you run your business like that,

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.300
no one will buy your clothes again.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.350
You just don't want to pay.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.000
It's not that.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.450
I'll pay whatever amount it costs.

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:27.540
But you can't rip me off.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.000
That's your attitude?

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.870
Guess we're not doing business
today then.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:31.710
Alright?

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.400
Come on.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.920
Come on, everyone, take a look!

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.000
This family

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.700
ruined my clothes!

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.080
How am I supposed to sell them now?

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.020
They don't want to pay!

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:41.290
Yeah, it's them. Remember.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.160
What's your problem?

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.440
- I'll pay you.
- What now?

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.470
Don't get physical.

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:45.900
- Hit me here.
- What are you doing?

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.200
If you've got guts, hit me here!

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.040
Stop!

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:48.880
Don't start a fight.

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:49.890
Let go.

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:51.080
- Stop looking.
- Step back.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:51.920
What are you doing?

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.040
Why get physical?

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.640
- What are you doing?
- What happened?

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:55.880
Nothing serious.

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:57.430
Her brother

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:58.320
just came to my store

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.510
and ruined my clothes,

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:01.680
so I came to ask her for compensation.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:02.960
They don't want to pay.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.280
I didn't do anything wrong, Kaifu.

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:06.470
I can pay.

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:07.420
But he's ripping me off.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:08.880
I'm not.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.060
I didn't ask for a cent more.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:14.670
Do you believe me?

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.870
I do.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:16.710
If you do,

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:17.830
leave this to me.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.510
Tell me your answer.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.630
Okay, Kaifu.

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:24.470
You decide.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.830
Fine.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:27.630
I'm doing Kaifu a favor.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.560
Alright, leave now.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.110
Thanks, Kaifu.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:35.470
It's alright.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:38.470
Don't cause trouble again; go home now.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:39.500
It's over. Stop watching.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.830
Got it.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.040
Ms. Qin.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.040
Don't be upset.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.280
A while ago,

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:07.650
he asked me to help sort out
the blocking issue.

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:08.990
He'd surely do me a favor.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.870
A pack of cigarettes is enough.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:13.990
Business is business.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:15.710
I said I'd compensate him, and I will.

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.320
300 yuan, thanks for handling it, Kaifu.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.260
Please give it to him.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.960
His clothes are worth at most 150.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.400
300 is more than fair.

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:22.560
Thanks, Kaifu.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:25.350
No need to thank me.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.920
You really live up to your name.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.800
Always honest and genuine.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.510
A rainbow (Hong) after the storm.

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:32.750
Even your name sounds pleasant.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.830
A Sennheiser speaker.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.280
Such a great speaker.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.630
There's a KTV across the street.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.960
I heard they use Sennheiser speakers.

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:53.470
All imported.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.960
Excellent sound quality.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.230
When you have time,

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.280
let's sing a song.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.800
Sennheiser.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.000
Imported.

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:09.470
You looked into me?

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:11.820
I didn't.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.750
If you didn't,
how'd you know I love singing?

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.680
I just asked around a bit.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:19.670
Asked around.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:22.800
Asked around?

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.040
So, if I don't sing this song with you,

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:31.200
you won't help me with this thing?

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.470
Those are two different things.

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:38.750
Singing is just singing.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:39.870
Business is business.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.200
You need to keep that temper
in check, okay?

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.630
Getting along with people matters.

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:48.630
You know that?

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:54.060
(Tian Cai)

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:13.820
(Tian Cai)

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:14.870
Alright, stay here.

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:16.400
Wait for my news, okay?

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:19.350
Liu.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.070
You've been reported several times
for blocking the lane.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.230
Do me a favor.

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:27.590
Sure thing.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.900
(Tian Cai)

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:37.800
Ms. Qin.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:38.790
Kaifu.

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:39.670
You wanted to see me?

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.070
What happened to the corner of your eye?

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:49.230
Two ladies from Third Street
got into a fight over a dress.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:50.870
I stepped in to break it up

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:51.730
and got scratched.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.640
It's nothing.

00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:58.440
I'm quitting my job anyway.

00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:59.560
I'm just tired of it.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:02.920
Take a seat.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.440
In our market here,

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.710
customers fight,

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:10.450
and merchants are against each other.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.560
I've had enough of it.

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.560
If everyone here were
as level-headed as you,

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:18.400
managing would be a breeze.

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:20.920
Same as me?

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:24.710
Then you'd be out of a job.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.830
That's fine.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.080
Actually, I could invest in your store.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.400
We could be partners.

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.950
Here.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.120
You

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.440
won't be unemployed.

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:47.960
This market wouldn't run without you.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.280
Does it hurt?

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:51.310
No.

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:55.550
It doesn't.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.320
What do you need me for?

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.920
Nothing major.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.280
I've been losing goods lately.

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:06.110
Not just once or twice.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.710
We don't even have cameras here.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:09.110
So, I was hoping you could find out

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.970
what's going on.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:11.260
Someone's been stealing from you?

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:12.830
How bold.

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:17.680
Don't be scared.

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:19.590
I'll handle this.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.350
I'm not scared.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.000
Thanks, Kaifu.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.560
No need to thank me.

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:26.870
I promise you this.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.510
If you lose another dress,

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.960
I'll pay for it out of my own pocket.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.120
Be careful.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.040
Thanks.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:44.920
Kaifu.

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.400
You guys eat.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.160
I'm not hungry.

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:52.180
(Tian Cai)

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.040
Kaifu.

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:54.710
Aren't we being too obvious?

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:56.920
Not really.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.750
How strange.

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.310
I've asked around the nearby stores.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:08.790
They didn't lose anything.

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.790
Only her store lost something.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:12.310
Kaifu.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:13.990
Do you have a thing for Hong?

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.470
Eat your pancake and be quiet.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:36.680
Stop!

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:37.920
Stop right there!

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.030
Stop! Don't run.

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:40.350
After him!

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:42.470
- Stop!
- Don't run!

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:43.310
Stop right there!

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:44.270
Stop!

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:45.710
- Stop!
- Don't run!

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:47.600
You two, block him from that side.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.670
Go that way and catch him.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.360
Stop!

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.310
Don't run!

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:57.550
- Over here, block the front.
- Got it.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:58.790
Stop right now!

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.200
Stop!

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:09.880
Still trying to run?

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.070
Don't, don't.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:11.960
You know me.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.300
- Cut me some slack.
- You okay?

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:14.270
Cut me some slack.

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:15.310
So exhausting.

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:16.600
What a runner.

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:20.230
It's fine; hold on a bit longer.

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:21.230
We're almost there.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:24.680
It's alright.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:26.790
At least we caught the thief.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:29.750
Driver.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:31.790
Turn on the ambulance light.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.790
Go straight to Chencang Sports Arena.

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:35.270
Why are we going to the arena?

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:38.270
I pulled some strings
and got us two tickets

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:39.790
for the concert of "The Same Song".

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.550
Nonsense.

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:42.400
We can't go there.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.640
Driver, head to the hospital.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.600
Don't listen to him.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.170
It took me a lot of effort to get this.

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:47.020
Take a break.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.230
What nonsense.

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:49.890
It's ridiculously pricey.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.260
(Tian Cai)

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:15.120
Alright, come back next time.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:15.990
Bye-bye!

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:17.200
Did you see Hong?

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.640
She hasn't opened her store for days.

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:40.070
Look at this article.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.400
In the Yiwu Garment Market,

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.200
merchants have been losing

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.990
their goods lately.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:50.550
After a thorough investigation,
Security Captain Zhao Kaifu

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:52.270
identified the suspect

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:54.120
and bravely captured the thief.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.600
Peace was restored to the market,

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.030
and merchants finally felt relieved.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:58.880
Everyone praised Captain Zhao,

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.990
saying he's such a great captain.

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:03.310
Stop teasing me.

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:04.750
A press release isn't like that.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:05.750
Well.

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:06.980
The one I made up is like that.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:09.360
Don't just eat.

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.710
Here, have some water.

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:18.350
Well.

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.040
Someone's gotta keep an eye

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.120
on your store.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:22.540
You should go back now.

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:23.550
Alright.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.060
I'll go once you finish your water.

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.230
Finish it.

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:40.400
I'm not leaving even if you've finished.

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:43.710
Then I'll take a walk outside.

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:44.710
Okay, I'll go with you.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.310
Why?

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.200
To walk around with you.

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.230
That's not convenient.

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:50.600
Why?

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.880
I suddenly don't feel like going.

00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:58.440
Why?

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.470
I just don't feel like it.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.270
Zhao Kaifu, what do you mean?

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:08.440
You keep avoiding me.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.160
Are we playing hide and seek now?

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.550
No, don't get the wrong idea.

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:12.680
I didn't mean that.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.060
Alright, I won't overthink it.

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:15.030
I'll go wherever you go,

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.100
and I won't overthink it.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:18.990
I'm going to the bathroom.

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:20.230
I'll give you a hand; let's go.

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:21.600
I'm going to the men's room.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.960
I'll give you a hand.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.600
Why would you go into the men's room?

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.120
What's wrong with me offering help?

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:29.070
Forget it.

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:35.920
What happened?

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:37.110
You're not going?

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.120
Then let's talk.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.310
Sure.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.400
What do you mean?

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.750
What are you mumbling?

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.230
You don't understand my condition.

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:52.790
I do. Of course I do.

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:53.990
The doctor

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:55.550
told me everything.

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:56.390
You just

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:01.400
got hurt a little.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:02.510
What's the big deal?

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:03.170
The doctor said

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:04.400
everything's functioning fine.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.750
What's the problem?

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:07.220
What kind of act are you putting on?

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:09.680
I just don't want to hold you back.

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:12.680
Since when do you decide that?

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.880
Shouldn't that be my call?

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.440
Are you playing the macho card now?

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.070
I'm not some macho guy.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.660
I had my fortune told when I was a kid.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.510
They said I'd be scared of my wife.

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:24.680
A man who's scared of his wife

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.550
can't really be macho.

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:29.440
Alright.

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:31.990
Keep pursuing me.

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:42.260

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:44.550

50.

Hong.

That's so tacky.

No, it's not.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.120
It's super trendy!

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.880
You didn't get to see

You can see one now.

Hong.

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:47.550
You're here.

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:50.840
When did this new place open?

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:52.200
Why didn't you tell me?

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:55.350
Danshun.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.310
I set this up with Kaifu.

00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:58.550
How does it look?

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:00.870
Danshun.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.640
Though this is

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.840
our first official meeting,

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.920
your sister talks
about you all the time.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.250
Come on.

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:09.230
Come over, have a seat.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.310
Big guy.

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:16.340
Come on.

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.790
It's a good day; let's have a drink.

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:21.590
Come on.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:24.160
You're too young to drink.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.120
I'm 18 already.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.400
Still no.

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:28.920
It's a day to celebrate.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:29.790
Let him drink.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:30.640
He's an adult now.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:32.640
Hey, Danshun.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.990
Come on, drink up.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.160
Let's drink together

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.030
to Hong.

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:40.680
Thanks for letting me join the store.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.900
Here's to us making big money.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:44.960
And best wishes to our Danshun.

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:46.470
May your studies go well.

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:47.640
May you ace the exams.

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:50.840
Slow down.

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:54.630
Danshun.

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:55.640
In a couple of days,

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:56.990
the clothing store will open.

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.830
You should come by.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.070
I'm not taking the Gaokao.

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.200
I've been learning tattooing.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.700
That's what I'll do after graduation.

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:05.880
Who told you to skip the exam?

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.870
You didn't even talk to me
before you made that decision?

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:09.920
You have to take the exam.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.840
You didn't talk to me
about your stuff, either.

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:17.070
That's not the same thing.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:18.120
If you stay here all day,

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.410
what kind of future can you get?

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:20.740
Aren't you also staying here?

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.360
Does that mean you've got no future?

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:25.990
Watch your tone.

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:29.960
Don't get worked up.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.600
Let's talk it through calmly.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.600
I'm done eating.

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:33.750
Don't touch my head again.

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:35.680
Danshun.

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:38.460
Ignore him; just eat.

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:41.350
Eat.

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:50.440
In business,
we make money through harmony.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.960
- Right?
- Right.

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.040
- Come on.
- Good.

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:54.810
Wishing you a booming business.

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:56.600
Thanks, everyone.

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:59.230
We'll look out for each other, okay?

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:00.400
Sure.

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:01.900
Wishing you a booming business.

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.130
Thanks.

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:05.550
Who arranged these flowers?

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:06.710
What did I tell you yesterday?

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.400
Move it in.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.120
You step out a little.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.990
Good, Captain.

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:20.310
Still got your old skills.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.340
You took some time off?

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:23.360
Of course.

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.640
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:26.870
Here, your favorite.

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:28.310
Liu.

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:34.220
(Tian Cai, Grand Opening)

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:40.050
Come on.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.230
Go inside and check on my girlfriend.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:45.710
- Who?
- My girlfriend.

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:47.200
You're so quick.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.310
You've found a girlfriend?

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:49.150
Hong.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.440
Hong.

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:51.680
Take your time.

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:57.490
My buddy from the army.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.060
A municipal criminal police.

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:00.230
Wang.

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:01.400
He's been talking about you.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.240
You're Wang, right?

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:02.870
Hello, Hong.

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:04.230
You even came in this heavy rain.

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:05.360
We really appreciate it.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.540
You know my bond with Kaifu.

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:07.440
If I didn't show up,

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.740
he'd probably tease me for life.

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:09.700
Am I that petty?

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.830
Are you saying that?

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:12.200
No, no. You're nothing like that.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.070
I'm the petty one.

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:14.600
You don't have to show up,

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:15.850
but your money has to be here.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:16.960
Watch how you talk.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:17.880
Of course.

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.920
Here.

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:19.640
I'm not taking it.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.120
Whoever is in charge should take it.

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.270
Hong, a small token of blessings.

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:24.840
Wishing you a great opening.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:25.880
May your business thrive.

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:28.200
Then I'll accept this good luck.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.680
Thank you, Wang.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.790
Let's get a photo together.

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:31.640
Come on.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.480
Come on.

Look toward the center.

Three, two, one.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.070
Why didn't Danshun come?

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:08.840

Still working now?

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:43.360
Let's grab something to eat

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.500
and have a couple of drinks.

00:30:58.790 --> 00:30:59.990
Kaifu, all the dishes are here.

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.930
Call me if you need me.

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:03.350
Have a drink.

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:05.880
Didn't Hong tell me not to drink?

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:08.120
Hong also said a real man drinks.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.310
It's our first time eating alone.

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.830
Cheers.

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:37.640
Here, eat something.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:40.600
What do you want from me?

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:46.360
Why have you been avoiding Hong lately?

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.790
I haven't. I've been busy.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:51.800
Because of me?

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.470
You're not that important.

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:02.270
You have feelings for Qin Hong.

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:07.960
I stole the woman you like.

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.070
That's why you're upset.

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:14.310
If that's true, just say yes.

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:16.880
Men are not so indecisive.

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.400
What did you just say? Say it again.

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:22.230
If you like her,

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:23.790
we should drink again.

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:27.150
Come on.

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:30.360
I've known Hong for ten years.

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:32.030
How long have you known her?

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:33.170
What makes you deserve her?

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.680
Feelings are tricky.

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:45.310
How long you've known her
doesn't matter.

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:53.470
Do you know what Hong needs?

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.640
She acts strong when she's with you.

00:32:59.120 --> 00:32:59.960
But deep down,

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:03.270
she needs someone who can protect her.

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:05.680
You can't give her that.

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.990
Why can't I?

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:08.700
I can protect her now.

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:09.550
All because of you.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:12.800
Yeah.

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:14.760
Because of me.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.640
I stole Qin Hong.

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:19.510
I'm right here.

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:20.680
What can you do to me?

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.310
I'll call the police.

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:25.160
Don't.

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.920
We were just kidding.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.480
Go back.

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.990
Do you feel better now?

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:51.680
If not,

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:54.470
I'll find a place

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:56.090
for you to vent it all out.

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:06.110
Danshun.

00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:09.070
You and Hong grew up together.

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:10.960
No one

00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:14.190
can ever erase those memories.

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:16.920
Hong doesn't belong to anyone.

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:18.920
She belongs only to herself.

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:21.070
She's with me.

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.240
That's my choice,

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:26.630
and hers as well.

00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:30.150
You need to respect that.

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:38.110
These past few days,

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.650
you've been giving her attitude.

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:42.920
She's barely eating

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:45.240
and can't sleep at night.

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:48.070
I've noticed it all.

00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:50.800
It breaks my heart.

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.190
You said you'd protect her.

00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:58.840
Is this how you do that?

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:04.720
I admit it.

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:06.920
Sometimes,

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.510
I envy you.

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:14.470
I told myself

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:18.630
that if one day Hong stops loving me,

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.920
she has every right

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:23.280
to walk away from me.

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:26.240
But you're different.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.960
She treats you like her brother.

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:33.720
She'd never leave you.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.070
You can't break her heart.

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.110
Right?

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:49.840
Hong will always

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.720
keep you in her heart.

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:56.240
She'd never let you go.

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:00.470
Think about it carefully.

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:19.340
(Chuan Q Tattoo)

00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:36.070
Why did you call me here?

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.630
To show you something.

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:42.800
I designed it.

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:43.990
Does it good?

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:49.800
Give me your hand.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.200
What for?

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:53.360
This hand.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.600
Sit here.

00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:58.440
You don't know there's a scar?

00:36:58.440 --> 00:36:59.280
I know.

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:01.670
You wear long sleeves all year round.

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:04.230
You always wear a silk scarf
on a hot day.

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:07.070
This design is specially made
to match your scar.

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:11.280
Look at that horizon.

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:12.590
It's just like your scar.

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:14.880
Once I ink it, you won't see it anymore.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.190
This is the first tattoo
I've ever wanted to do.

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:28.800
What?

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:32.600
- The first one.
- The first one?

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:35.400
Are you using me as a guinea animal?

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.540
Just to practice your skills?

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.880
Come on, go ahead.

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.520
You'd better be sure about this.

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:48.470
Once it's on, you can't wash it off.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.320
Do it. I'm not scared.

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:52.190
Besides, the design looks pretty cool.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:53.830
If you mess it up,

00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:54.710
it'll be on my wrist.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.110
Better mine than a client's, right?

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:57.590
Can you give me a little confidence?

00:37:57.590 --> 00:37:58.150
Cheer me up.

00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.110
What more do you want?

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.510
I even let you do this.

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:01.630
You brat.

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:03.190
You don't know a thing.

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:10.630
I'll start now.

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:24.060
You're really dropping out of school?

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:28.400
I honestly like this job.

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:32.070
Whatever happens down the road,

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.150
I just wanna give it a try first.

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:37.150
I'm your brother.

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:38.590
I won't let you down.

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:47.510
Then you'd better think it through.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.470
Once you quit school,
there's no turning back.

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:53.670
I can take responsibility for myself.

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:56.630
You...

00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:58.670
Don't move.

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.990
All done.

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:42.220
(Tian Cai)

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:46.950
The market just got
a new batch of clothes.

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:48.630
We've got your size.

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:49.470
Here.

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:53.120
What for?

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:54.720
Need a favor from me?

00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:56.630
Got you a shirt.

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.030
This meal is on you.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:00.120
Of course.

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:04.840
Do you still remember

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:06.160
Huang Shuquan?

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.200
Yeah.

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:11.630
He used to collect protection fees
at our market.

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:13.400
I got him locked up.

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:16.210
He served a few years inside

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:17.760
and was released last year.

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:20.400
Still playing the same underworld games.

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:22.440
He's gotten some influence.

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:24.400
I've been keeping tabs on him lately.

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:26.510
He's a suspect

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:27.750
in several recent cases we got.

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:29.400
I also found out

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.510
he's been hanging

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:31.760
around your area a lot lately.

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.440
Just giving you a heads-up.

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:35.720
Be careful.

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.070
I'm worried he holds a grudge
against you.

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:42.720
Got it.

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:51.380
(Tian Cai)

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:53.030
Passers-by are looking at you.

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:54.590
Such a big shot

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:56.960
climbing a ladder to fix a store sign.

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.440
Aren't you afraid people will laugh?

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:02.720
I'm fixing the sign
for my girlfriend's store.

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:04.510
Why would I care if people laugh?

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:06.470
(Tian Cai)

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:07.400
Come on, give it a try.

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:09.590
Hold it steady.

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:10.720
No worries.

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:15.090
- Is it lit?
- Is it working?

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.290
How do you know how to do everything?

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:25.630
Graduated from the school of life.

00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:26.920
A true all-round talent.

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:27.760
Take it easy.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:36.800
Kaifu.

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:44.590
Still strong as ever.

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:48.320
What brings you here?

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:50.800
That's not a nice way to put it.

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:52.360
We haven't met in years.

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:53.510
I've actually missed you.

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:55.760
Can't I just drop by and visit?

00:41:58.440 --> 00:41:59.720
Let me introduce you.

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:03.320
This is the well-known Kaifu.

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.400
He runs this whole clothing market.

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:07.400
Don't say it like that.

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:09.760
I'm no gang guy.

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.920
Is this your girlfriend?

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:17.440
What's this about?

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.360
It's a long story.

00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:37.070
Your girlfriend has great taste.

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:39.760
I've walked past so many stores
on my way here.

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:42.400
But yours is the one that stands out.

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:44.840
Once I came in,

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:46.490
your girlfriend stood out, too.

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:49.880
Kaifu, you're so lucky.

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.510
We mainly sell women's clothing.

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:53.210
Feel free to take a look.

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:56.240
Are you buying it as a gift

00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:58.320
or for yourself?

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:01.110
Watch how you talk.

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.830
Kaifu.

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:10.840
You actually guessed it right.

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:13.190
For all your clothes,

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:14.510
give me the total price.

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:15.800
I'll take them all.

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:17.510
What do you mean?

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:21.190
Your store isn't bad at all.

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:23.410
How about this?

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:25.800
Sell the store to me, too.

00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:35.760
Who runs a store without profits?

00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:36.950
Let me think.

00:43:58.740 --> 00:43:59.840
For the clothes downstairs,

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:01.150
a total of 43,000.

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.670
There's still 40,000 worth
of clothes upstairs.

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:05.750
I can give it to you at a lower price.

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:06.510
100,000 in total.

00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:07.430
Deal.

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:08.840
As for this store,

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:11.320
Kaifu and I put a lot of effort into it,

00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:12.440
so it's not cheap.

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:14.150
It's ten million.

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:21.150
Ten million?

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:22.880
You're joking, right?

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:23.920
No.

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:25.840
If you think the price is too high,

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:27.960
you can just take the clothes instead.

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.030
Kaifu,

00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:39.240
I think you've misunderstood me.

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:41.400
Let me be honest with you.

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.990
All the other clothing markets

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:45.150
are renovating now.

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:46.670
But this place

00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:48.670
is getting more rundown by the day.

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:50.630
I feel really down.

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.280
Why?

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:54.400
Because I'm attached to this place.

00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:58.320
And I've stumbled here before.

00:44:58.320 --> 00:44:59.290
Isn't that right, Kaifu?

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:02.320
Over the past few years,

00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:04.240
I managed to make some money.

00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:05.920
So, I wanted to buy

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:07.720
all the stores around here

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:09.320
to make a plan

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.470
for renovation

00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:12.960
and change the market completely.

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:16.470
If you still want to run

00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:17.550
a clothing store by then,

00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:19.850
I'll rent the space to you
at a lower price.

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:21.800
That's a good thing.

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:24.880
Right, Kaifu?

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:26.590
How about this?

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:27.470
Help him out

00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:29.760
and introduce him to someone
from the committee.

00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:31.510
Let me give you an idea.

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:33.190
You make a donation

00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:36.190
and cover all the renovation costs.

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:39.030
It'll cost way less
than buying these stores.

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.440
The committee might even
put up a plaque for you

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:42.360
at the intersection.

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.300
Everyone passing by will see it

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:45.240
and pay their respects.

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:47.360
It's honorable, respectable,
and builds goodwill.

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:48.200
How nice.

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:50.350
Kaifu,

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:53.190
your girlfriend is so eloquent.

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.190
Think it over carefully.

00:45:56.590 --> 00:45:58.150
Give me a practical price.

00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:59.280
I already told you.

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:01.670
It's not for sale.

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:12.110
Times have changed, Kaifu.

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:16.550
Do you think
I'm still the same Huang Shuquan?

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.030
Yes, times have changed.

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:22.320
However,

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:23.340
I can't change who I am.

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:28.740
Well.

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:30.280
You two should discuss it.

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:31.670
I'll wait for your good news.

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:32.870
Bye.

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:54.440
There's always someone
standing at the door.

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:56.550
Customers don't even dare

00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:57.840
to come into our store anymore.

00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:59.720
How are we supposed
to do business like this?

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:02.510
What is Huang Shuquan trying to do?

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:06.470
I looked into it.

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:07.840
Kaifu.

00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:13.880
Our area is about to be demolished.

00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:15.630
Huang Shuquan

00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:17.880
probably wants to buy a few stores here

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:21.010
to negotiate with the developer

00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:22.390
and sell them off at a high price.

00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:23.310
No wonder.

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:25.470
If you ask me,

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.550
we might as well sell him the store.

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.240
It'll save us from all this trouble.

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:30.840
- Zhang.
- That won't work.

00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:31.910
If you do that,

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:33.540
you're putting everyone in a tough spot.

00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:34.670
What do you mean by that?

00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:35.960
Take this toothpick here.

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:38.030
One snap and it breaks.

00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:40.840
But if you grab a bunch of them,

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:42.550
they're much harder to snap.

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:46.320
Isn't Huang Shuquan going door to door,

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:47.400
trying to scare you all?

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:49.240
I think our priority now

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.440
is to set up

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:53.510
a demolition committee.

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.800
Everyone needs to sign
and press their fingerprint.

00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:58.240
Before we reach out to the developer,

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:00.320
we shouldn't talk to anyone else.

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:01.760
Do you agree?

00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:03.240
- Yes.
- Sure.

00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:04.840
Kaifu's idea is spot on.

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.920
Let's set up a demolition committee.

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:08.150
If Huang Shuquan wants to talk,

00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:10.320
he can come to the committee, right?

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:11.670
- Sure.
- Okay.

00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:13.150
Then we'll follow Kaifu's lead.

00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:14.320
Yeah, we listen to Kaifu.

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.420
- We'll follow you.
- Yes.

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:30.720
What's going on here so late?

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:31.960
Watch where you're going.

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:33.800
Come on.

00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:37.950
Where are you going?

00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.880
What are you doing?

00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:40.960
Who are you?

00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:42.560
Liu.

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:44.360
Someone's gotta go

00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:45.880
and talk to Shuquan first.

00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:47.790
I think you're the right guy for that.

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:52.070
Listen.

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:53.760
We've formed a demolition committee.

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:54.760
If you want to negotiate,

00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:56.360
go to the committee and talk to Kaifu.

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:57.320
Are you saying

00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:58.880
you're not willing to talk to Shuquan?

00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:00.760
I...

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:01.760
I won't talk to him.

00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:03.630
Let's stop wasting our time.

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:06.200
What are you doing?

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:07.960
Help! Somebody help!

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:09.280
Help!

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:10.880
What are you doing? Let go!

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:11.950
Let go!

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.470
- Kaifu!
- Kaifu, you're here!

00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:25.400
How's he doing?

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:27.240
He's inside. Go check on him.

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:35.680
Liu.

00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:37.160
Kaifu.

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.760
You're sure
Huang Shuquan's people did this?

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:42.280
Yes.

00:49:43.590 --> 00:49:45.260
Do you remember everyone
who attacked you?

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:46.640
Yes.

00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:53.590
Mrs. Liu,

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:54.610
I didn't bring anything.

00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:55.880
- No.
- Take the money.

00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:57.030
No, Kaifu, we can't take it.

00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.880
- Kaifu.
- We can't.

00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:58.770
Do as I say.

00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:02.210
Focus on getting better.

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:04.840
- No.
- Kaifu.

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:06.110
Kaifu, Kaifu.
