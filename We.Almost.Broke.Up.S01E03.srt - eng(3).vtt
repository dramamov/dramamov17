00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.520
(This is a work of fiction)

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.120
Get up. We're going out.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.320
Where are we going?

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.480
Didn't you say you wanted to test the projection?

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.040
This one, right?

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.200
This is the one.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.680
We're buying it.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.520
That's it?

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.160
Let's go home and watch the projection.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.880
If it changes, that means we passed this level.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.480
And my guess is right.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.160
Not bad, Chen Jia Wen.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.359
I told you already.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.960
I'm a genius.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.760
Let's quickly see how to pass the next level.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.040
I really want to put you in my pocket.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.320
Then wherever I go, I can take you with me.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.400
Then you'll get tired of me very quickly.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.960
Never.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.360
Chen Jia Wen,

00:02:31.361 --> 00:02:33.320
I advise you to mind your words from now on.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.200
You're always running your mouth.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.480
You're blaming me again.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.200
Look how happy you were smiling.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.320
What should we do next?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Become conjoined twins?

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.600
Haven't you noticed that we've been holding hands...

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.640
since we woke up?

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.120
Don't be nervous.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.320
Listen to me. This level is the easiest.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.680
Let's lie in bed all day today.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.080
Then we'll pass this level.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.800
No way... I'm not mentally prepared yet.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.400
Let's pass this level another day.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.760
See?

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.440
What's going on?

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.296
It resets once we don't hold hands?

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.320
Are we...

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.279
going to stay like this for a day?

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.040
What's wrong with staying with me for a day?

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.960
I got it.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.239
If you stay with me for a day, you won't be able...

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.520
to see your little lover, right?

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.680
What little lover?

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.399
You've already made it official on social media.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.400
I saw it.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.040
We broke up, so I don't mind.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.240
You really keep up with my updates.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.600
I just accidentally saw it,

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.920
okay?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Besides,

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.679
I'm quite curious about your new boyfriend.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.680
Come on, let me meet him.

00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:51.799
Fine.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.160
It doesn't matter anyway.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.800
You're quite open.

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:56.080
- Let's go. - Come on.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.760
- Let's go. - Come on.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.520
Welcome.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.440
Sit wherever you want.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.800
Let's sit here.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.200
Hello.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.800
Enjoy.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.200
That's him?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Your little lover?

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.439
What little lover?

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.520
What are you talking about?

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.640
Stop pretending.

00:04:57.641 --> 00:04:59.200
Look at the way he stares at you...

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.680
with those smoldering eyes.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.120
Hello.

00:05:03.121 --> 00:05:05.239
This is our newly-released item.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.920
We're giving it to our customers for free.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.480
Stop right there.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.640
I'm still here.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.799
How dare you draw a heart for her?

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.800
Am I too nice to you?

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.879
Are you crazy, Chen Jia Wen?

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.920
Answer my question first.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.520
Did you two get together long ago?

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.160
No.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.440
No?

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.720
Then why would he look at you like that?

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.800
I was still there.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.400
We were even holding hands.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.000
I can't be bothered to explain.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.160
Act.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.760
Just put on an act.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.280
No.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.599
I'll make you stop acting.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.600
Let's go.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.080
Where are we going?

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.880
Welcome.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.440
Wait. What are you doing?

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.440
Can't you see this lady isn't willing?

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.480
Can't you see this?

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.399
I don't care what your relationship is.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.880
As long as this lady is unwilling,

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.720
you can't force her.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.280
Who are you to teach me?

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.160
Look at you.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.600
You can't keep acting, can you?

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.160
I caught you, didn't I?

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.519
You actually bit me to save him.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.880
Why should you hit him?

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.760
What did he do wrong?

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.960
You're mad now?

00:06:39.961 --> 00:06:41.639
He just fell in love with me at first sight.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.640
How often does love at first sight happen?

00:06:42.641 --> 00:06:44.521
Didn't you fall in love with me at first sight?

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.000
You don't believe me, right?

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.240
Fine.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.760
I'll prove it to you.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.480
Just wait.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.240
He confesses every time.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.919
If he doesn't confess today,

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.240
won't we have waited for nothing?

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.600
He'll surely do it.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.920
If I didn't happen...

00:07:18.921 --> 00:07:20.240
to like the scenery here,

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.800
I wouldn't believe...

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.760
that there's someone in this world...

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.360
who can love me...

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.800
no matter what I look like.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.640
(Being unhappy isn't allowed in this place)

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.280
It doesn't matter if I don't know his name.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.680
It doesn't matter if we don't have a future.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.040
All I want...

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.519
is this moment...

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.960
of being firmly chosen by him.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.680
This is the feeling Chen Jia Wen hasn't given me in a long time.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.280
You've miscalculated.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.640
He has no intention of confessing at all.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.640
Let's wait some more.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.319
Wait some more? We've been waiting all day.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.720
I've run out of patience. Let's go.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.799
Just be honest with me.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.000
We've already broken up. What can I do to you?

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.240
I like you.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.560
From the moment you walked in,

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.800
I've liked you.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.639
You don't have to respond.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.040
You don't have to feel burdened either.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.120
I just...

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.920
want to tell you.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.680
I'm sorry, sir.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.040
I know this is very presumptuous of me.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.200
But I thought if I...

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.680
don't say it today,

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.720
I might never get the chance to say it again.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.280
See?
