00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:30.679
You don't recognize my face,

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:33.799
but do you recognize my scar?

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:50.240
Nan?

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.679
Is it really you?

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:52.920
You're alive!

00:00:53.824 --> 00:00:54.320
Nan,

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.439
your face...

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.759
You don't have to pretend
to care about me.

00:01:05.408 --> 00:01:05.959
Nan,

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:08.599
I've been looking for you these years.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.959
I know

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:11.799
you must still be alive.

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.200
Well, Shi Yu.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.200
You truly excel at manipulating people.

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:24.640
The pawn I've cultivated for years

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.200
becomes completely enchanted by you

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.280
within only half a month.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.608
Nan,

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.400
even you bear grudge against me,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.599
this has nothing to do with Cheng Ge.

00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:40.519
You came alone

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:42.280
to rescue such a completely

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:45.040
unrelated woman.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.680
I'm your own brother.

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:52.319
Haven't I treated you well enough?

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.200
How have you treated me?

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:57.200
But I've never wanted to kill you.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.400
Still trying to trick me?

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.799
Nan,

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.360
we can discuss these in detail later.

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:10.680
Save Cheng Ge first, okay?

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.879
Isn't she your disciple?

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.759
She betrayed me long ago.

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:17.159
Just days ago,

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.919
she saved you, right?

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.759
Why should I save such a traitor?

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:23.280
If you save her,

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:24.639
I'll let

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.240
you take the throne.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.759
If I kill you.

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.960
I can still reclaim
what's rightfully mine.

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:36.400
Killing me now is pointless.

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:39.240
Now, Gao Ji controls the court.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.039
If I die,

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.719
the empire will not belong
to the Shi family.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.439
And you don't look like
the one you used to. Without me,

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.719
you can't return.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.199
Cheng Ge.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.759
You...

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:21.159
You want me to save her?

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.599
I did.

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:25.479
But don't actually think

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:27.439
I'll trust you without any guarantees.

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:29.360
Help me reclaim the throne

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.680
and regain everything
that belongs to me,

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.000
and then I'll let her go.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.280
So you're actually

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:44.719
Shi Nan?

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.479
You're not from Pingxiang.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.039
You incited our desire for revenge,

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:56.199
all to serve your own selfish desires.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.159
The throne was originally mine.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.759
He stole my position.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.960
If it weren't for your incompetence,

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.080
why would Pingxiang people rebel?

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.759
That was due to their utter stupidity.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.400
You are the same.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.079
You betrayed me for Shi Yu,

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.639
yet killed your fellow townsman.

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:40.160
I'll kill you!

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:42.240
Kill me?

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.319
You can't even protect yourself.

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:49.439
What do you need me to do?

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:55.680
I've said it.

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:58.240
Get the imperial seal back.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.079
and let me take the throne.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.959
Otherwise,

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.360
you just wait for her death.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.600
Okay.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.120
I agree.

00:05:25.079 --> 00:05:25.519
Come on.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.920
I never imagined

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:38.240
he's been deceiving me
for so many years.

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.319
Only now do I realize

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:44.720
what truly happened
in Pingxiang back then.

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:48.199
Back then, my brother sent Gao Ji
to quell Pingxiang rebellion.

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:49.680
He never expected

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:51.879
Gao Ji seized power and took control.

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:53.720
Gao Ji used

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.480
my background of growing up in Pingxiang

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:57.360
to gain Pingxiang people's trust.

00:05:58.079 --> 00:06:00.879
Then he took advantage of me
to kill my brother.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.040
Finally, he broke his promise

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:04.399
and massacred Pingxiang.

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:06.319
Now

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.439
he controls the court,

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:08.639
monopolizing all power.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.439
All of this

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:13.439
shall be accounted to Gao Ji.

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:16.040
But is Shi Nan blameless?

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.600
Had he not been tyrannical,

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.736
how could Pingxiang's people rebel?

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.720
Actually,

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.240
my brother genuinely
cared for the people.

00:06:27.079 --> 00:06:27.759
I never imagined

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:31.240
he'd eventually become intoxicated
with power.

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:33.279
Gao Ji must be dealt with.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.519
But after eliminating him,

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.480
if you want to let Shi Nan
take the throne,

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.000
I will cease supporting you.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.680
If I don't do it,

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:43.839
your poison...

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:44.879
Have you ever considered

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:47.439
that Shi Nan's unworthiness to rule

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.839
made him like this today?

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:53.399
There are too many people
who need protection.

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:56.439
You cannot remain shackled by me.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.920
What are you doing?

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:25.639
Your Majesty left the palace,

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:26.560
and I

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.759
was concerned for your safety.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.319
Must I report

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.199
every detail of my itinerary?

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:33.600
Certainly not.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.519
However, with Your Majesty absent,

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:37.759
we grow anxious about the state

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:40.120
and your safety as well.

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:42.560
I appreciate your concern.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.000
As you see, I remain unharmed.

00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:46.720
Wait.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.680
When you were attacked earlier,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.360
in this vast palace,

00:07:53.839 --> 00:07:56.120
only this waiting maid survived.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.160
Today when I faced assassination,

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.319
I observed

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:02.160
the assassin's eyes

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.720
bear striking resemblance

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.920
to your waiting maid.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.680
I've already clarified

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.160
that she

00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:13.040
was dressing me back then.

00:08:14.199 --> 00:08:15.279
You misunderstand.

00:08:15.879 --> 00:08:18.600
I firmly believe your waiting maid

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.319
would never attempt to assassinate me.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.279
Yet mysteries abound in this affair.

00:08:22.279 --> 00:08:24.560
I shall simply take her for questioning.

00:08:25.079 --> 00:08:26.800
Should any harm befall you

00:08:26.959 --> 00:08:28.519
due to my negligence,

00:08:28.519 --> 00:08:29.279
then I

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.200
could never atone
even through my deaths.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.440
Gao Ji, you...

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:43.679
Cheng Ge.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:45.799
Cheng Ge.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.360
Cheng Ge.

00:08:52.759 --> 00:08:53.279
Let's go.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.000
Okay.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.200
His Majesty is well-occupied,

00:08:59.559 --> 00:09:00.559
so it's been so long

00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:02.159
since he last visited the Empress.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.360
Someone!

00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:04.240
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:09:04.519 --> 00:09:06.279
Escort His Majesty
to the Empress' chambers.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.000
Grant them privacy

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.639
to exchange heartfelt words.

00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:11.120
Don't worry.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.600
Refreshments have been prepared.

00:09:17.759 --> 00:09:18.919
Seize her!

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:19.840
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.144
She didn't confess?

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.519
I'm not cruel by nature.

00:10:08.679 --> 00:10:09.799
Confess right away

00:10:10.759 --> 00:10:13.240
and spare yourself suffering.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:22.679
Alright.

00:10:24.159 --> 00:10:25.960
What admirable resolve.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.840
Let me ask you.

00:10:28.279 --> 00:10:29.799
What did you do after leaving

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.399
the palace with Shi Yu?

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.120
This morning,

00:10:52.559 --> 00:10:54.200
was it you who tried to kill me?

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.600
How would a frail woman like me

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.000
have the courage

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.000
to assassinate you?

00:11:07.399 --> 00:11:08.399
Frail woman?

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:10.720
Very well.

00:11:20.519 --> 00:11:21.799
Then it seems necessary

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.320
to refresh your memory thoroughly.

00:11:33.799 --> 00:11:34.399
My lord,

00:11:34.639 --> 00:11:36.120
even if she isn't the assassin,

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.360
she's clearly a seductress.
