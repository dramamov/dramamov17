00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:06.799
This is for you.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.079
Thanks.

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:14.120
What's on your mind?

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:15.480
You seem distracted.

00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:19.760
Haven't you found that jade pendant?

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.560
It's alright.

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.120
You've reclaimed the hotel after all.

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.280
I'll help you look for the jade pendant.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.480
No matter what it takes,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.519
I'll find it for you.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.040
Oh, right.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.719
I've got another gift for you.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.040
It's my silver spear!

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.400
I found this at the black market.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.400
I just thought of trying my luck.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.959
To my surprise, I found it there.

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.000
This is considered
a thousand-year-old antique.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I bet it was expensive.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.400
I can't accept it.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.199
Just take it.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.199
It belongs to you anyway.

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:17.879
Also, don't you think it's all fated?

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.350
Even though a millennium has passed,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.400
some cherished objects
remain reclaimable.

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:28.919
Thank you, then.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.479
Muyan.

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:35.879
You've done more than enough for me.

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.390
In fact, you need not treat me so well.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.560
Have you forgotten this, General?

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.400
You saved my life.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.520
Don't let him get away!

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.240
Quick! Give chase!

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.000
Over there!

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.960
Stop right there!

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:17.120
Everyone, get up!

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.960
Hurry up!

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.719
Give chase now!

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:20.220
Stop running!

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.850
Stop running!

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.439
Stop right there!

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:27.719
You're a pretty good runner, huh?

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.280
You wanted to report that
to the official, huh?

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.919
Dream on!

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:32.479
Get rid of him!

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:53.680
Get rid of him!

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.079
Go! Let's go now!

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.279
- Let's go.
- Go.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.240
I've dealt with those bullies.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.959
You're no longer a runaway after this.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.399
Go home.

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:43.759
If you have nowhere to be,

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.680
join my army, then.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Thank you so much.

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:26.399
Nice one!

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:28.759
One more time!

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.480
I see.

00:05:51.845 --> 00:05:52.806
It was you!

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:55.240
General.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.120
Please allow me

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.040
to treat you well forever.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.360
Just leave such matters to Mr. Shen.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.920
That won't do.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.639
It's too personal of a matter.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.959
The elevator isn't working today.

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:22.980
We have to use the stairs.

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:23.780
Greetings, Mr. Gu.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.199
Hi.

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:25.920
Slowly.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.319
Chenyu.

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:29.920
I'm sorry,

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.879
but I forgot the keys.

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:32.360
I'll take them now. I'll be back soon.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.439
Wait for me.

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:33.839
Sure.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.560
Greetings, Mr. Gu.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.279
Greetings, Mr. Gu.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.240
Hi.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:55.990
You're still here, Mr. Gu.

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:57.800
Bye.

00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:06.680
Mr. Gu.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.120
Do you need any help?

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:11.720
Just get back to work.

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:13.600
Yes.

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:21.360
Greetings, Mr. Gu.

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:27.639
Mr. Gu!

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.959
Are you okay?

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.040
What's this?

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:31.199
Are you okay?

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.439
Are you alright, Mr. Gu?

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.480
Chenyu!

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.600
Are you okay, Chenyu?

00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:37.720
Chenyu!

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:39.199
Shiqi.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.120
Help me up.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:41.920
Mr. Gu.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:42.920
It's me, Ruyin.

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:44.480
Can't you see me?

00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:45.720
He can't see us?

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.079
What's the matter with Mr. Gu?

00:07:47.079 --> 00:07:48.320
How did he fell down the stairs?

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:49.879
He can't see us.

00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:50.959
Has he gone blind?

00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:54.120
Do you want us to get you
an ambulance, Mr. Gu?

00:08:00.959 --> 00:08:03.040
(Gu Group recently released
a statement saying)

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.680
(that its CEO, Gu Chenyu,
has suspended all work)

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.199
(due to sudden blindness.)

00:08:07.439 --> 00:08:09.040
(According to an insider,)

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.190
(Gu Chenyu's vision problems
are very serious.)

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.519
(He fell down the stairs in public
and lost consciousness.)

00:08:13.519 --> 00:08:13.800
Chenyu...

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.839
(His current condition remains unknown.)

00:08:14.839 --> 00:08:16.560
I didn't want you to hear any of this,

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.800
but I think

00:08:18.319 --> 00:08:20.199
since it concerns the company,

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:21.519
you should at least know about it.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.120
But don't worry.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.439
I'll handle
all the public opinion issues.

00:08:25.959 --> 00:08:28.399
For now, the most important thing
for you is to rest well

00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:29.519
and take care of your eyes.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.320
I'll head to work now.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.180
If you need anything,
just ask the housekeeper.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.200
Let me do it.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.720
Are you okay?

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.080
I heard you fell down the stairs.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.200
Are you here to mock at me?

00:09:18.279 --> 00:09:19.159
Yeah.

00:09:19.159 --> 00:09:21.080
After years of scheming,

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.879
in the end, you got nothing.

00:09:24.639 --> 00:09:25.440
You should leave.

00:09:29.879 --> 00:09:31.000
Are you okay?

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.279
Gu Chenyu.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.840
Can you stop making me worry?

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.080
I'll stay and help you

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.600
until you get better.

00:09:44.559 --> 00:09:45.840
I don't need your pity.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.039
Gu Chenyu.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.320
I've seen countless people
worse off than you.

00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:58.480
Their families have been torn apart.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.279
They are homeless

00:09:59.279 --> 00:10:00.519
and physically disabled.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.300
Every one of them
is more miserable than you.

00:10:03.559 --> 00:10:04.639
Someone like you

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.879
doesn't deserve my sympathy.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.200
Then why are you back here?

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:11.919
I...

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:22.960
Why are you here?

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.679
He was stabbed because of me.

00:10:27.399 --> 00:10:28.519
He can't see now.

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:31.190
I'd like to stay here
until his recovery.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.480
