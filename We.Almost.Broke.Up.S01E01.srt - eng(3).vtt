00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.520
(This is a work of fiction)

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.200
Come on.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.160
Shen Meng.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.200
We...

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.160
Name?

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.240
Chen Jia Wen.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.400
What is...

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.600
Shen Meng's relationship with you?

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.920
Shen Meng was my girlfriend.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.000
We were together for four years.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.200
We just broke up.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.240
Officer.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.480
How is Shen Meng now?

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.840
She fell from so high up. What do you think?

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.800
Now, you care about her.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.000
Where were you before?

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.360
She passed away.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.560
I'm doomed.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.560
You are doomed.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.840
Just tell the truth.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.640
She'll surely kill me tomorrow.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.120
Who's going to kill you tomorrow?

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.720
Shen Meng will surely kill me tomorrow.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.760
Shen Meng...

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.800
will kill you tomorrow?

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.919
I know you won't believe me,

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.039
but once tomorrow comes,

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.519
everything will be reset, you know?

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.959
Don't give me that nonsense.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.999
Tell the truth. Why did you kill her?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.999
I didn't kill her. She jumped on her own.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.159
We'll investigate clearly if you killed her or not.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.279
But I have to tell you,

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.160
inciting someone to suicide is a crime too.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.720
Tell us.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.080
What exactly happened?

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.560
Shen Meng!

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.160
Chen Jia Wen.

00:03:11.161 --> 00:03:13.560
Let's not waste each other's time, okay?

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.920
I'll give you 10 more minutes.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.240
I know this sounds ridiculous,

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.040
but I swear,

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.880
everything I'm about to tell you is true.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.000
On the night of May 20th,

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.640
we had a big fight...

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.120
and decided to break up.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.560
I slept on the couch,

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.680
and she slept on the bed.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.360
But when I woke up the next day,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.160
I was inexplicably sleeping beside her.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.240
One day,

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.080
what if the world really ends?

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.360
Don't worry.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.120
I'll do whatever it takes to keep you alive.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.680
Even if I live,

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.200
I'll only waste my remaining life...

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.840
reminiscing and being lonely.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.520
What's the point?

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.240
I want to die before you.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.680
You can't.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.839
Can you bear to see me grow old alone?

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.840
I can't live without you.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.520
I don't want to live in a world without you either.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.920
Then let's die together.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.680
That's so disgusting.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.240
But I...

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.120
I think we really did say those things before.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.240
Look at the time.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.200
(May 20th)

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.160
Darn.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.040
Zhao.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.960
You're Shen Meng's childhood friend...

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.040
and also my best friend.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.880
We only told you about this.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.480
What do you think?

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.520
According to my deduction,

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.440
this matter isn't simple.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.720
Do you even need to deduce that?

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.279
I've always believed that a more advanced civilization...

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.360
is watching over mankind in this universe.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.680
Can you understand that?

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.640
Don't people always say,

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.360
"It's all fate."

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.520
"It's all destined."

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.159
It's very likely...

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.680
that we are characters written by a more advanced civilization.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.440
I've always thought I was the Chosen One,

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.959
and everyone around me,

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:38.960
including you guys,

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.160
are all NPCs.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.400
I didn't expect...

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.520
to become a supporting character.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.880
I didn't expect you...

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.280
to really believe it.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.560
He believes me, not you.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.920
Wait, dude.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.400
You're a lawyer.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.360
How can you be so non-materialistic?

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.640
Obviously,

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.599
you two have entered...

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.160
a loop called 520.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.000
If you can't find a way to break it,

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.280
you'll be trapped in this day forever.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.880
If I may ask, who started the loop?

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.040
Who?

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.680
And who can enter this loop?

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.760
Who?

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.760
You answer.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.080
The Chosen One.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.520
Yes, that's right.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.600
Wait...

00:06:27.601 --> 00:06:29.599
I feel like you just said a bunch of nonsense.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.720
So how do we get out of it?

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
That's right.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.160
Don't worry.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.920
Knowing the heavens as I do,

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.520
clues must have been left for you.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.120
Find them yourselves.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.400
Zhao was right.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.240
Since then,

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.800
we've been stuck on this day.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.480
Everything resets on time at 12am sharp.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.600
The projection wakes us up at 8am.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.120
To break the loop,

00:07:09.121 --> 00:07:11.120
we tried every possibility.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.080
Shen Meng said...

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.080
maybe the universe...

00:07:14.081 --> 00:07:15.880
just didn't want us to break up.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.680
So we pretended to make up.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.520
Let's do it.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.160
Three, two, one.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
We made up.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Yes.

00:07:31.001 --> 00:07:32.440
We love each other very much.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.719
We're madly in love.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.720
Trust us.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.600
But it didn't work.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.640
So we searched movies, TV shows,

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.320
novels, and games about loops.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.560
Maybe somewhere in this building,

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.440
there's a pressure cooker with a bomb.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.240
Maybe our lives are a show...

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.760
with hidden cameras everywhere.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.880
Maybe we're not even human,

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.880
but NPCs in a game,

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.960
and there's a bug in the game's program.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.560
But all our efforts were in vain.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.040
One day,

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.680
what if the world really ends?

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.080
Why isn't May 20th the end of the world?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Don't worry.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.760
I'll do whatever it takes to keep you alive.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.320
I've lived enough.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.360
What about you?

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.880
I swear.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.680
At that moment, I really wanted to die.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.280
Living the same day...

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.800
is no different from dying.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.480
However,

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.840
I'm afraid of heights, so...

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:50.960
Don't upset him.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.120
Officer.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.520
Everything I said...

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.960
is true.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.320
I know.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.600
"Groundhog Day",

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.880
"Triangle", "Source Code".

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.440
I've seen this kind of movies.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.040
In other words, you and the victim are trapped on the same day.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.800
- Yes. - For a long time,

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.080
you never found a way to break the loop.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.280
That's right.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.000
The heavens don't want us to get out of it.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.600
So Shen Meng didn't die.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.119
After midnight, everything that happened today...

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.520
will be reset.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.359
You've also watched "The Mermaid", right?

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.600
Is it that funny?

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.960
No.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.480
The loop appeared suddenly, right?

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.199
- Yes. - Then have you ever considered...

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.920
that the loop can also suddenly disappear?

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.759
- What do you mean? - What I mean is,

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.520
if it doesn't reset today,

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.560
the victim would really be dead.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.120
That's impossible.

00:09:50.121 --> 00:09:51.176
It's absolutely impossible.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.000
Because it's almost May 21st.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.000
Come on. We'll wait for the reset with you.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.040
Look. How do you explain this?

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.400
What else do you have to say?

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.320
That's impossible.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.280
Your watch seems to be fast.
