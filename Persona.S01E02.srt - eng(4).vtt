Officer Liu, you're here again.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.000
- Is she in her room?
- No.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.960
She's in the activity room.
I'll take you there.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:11.800

Officer Liu,

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.640
Qin Hong's case has been over
for more than a year.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.760
You still drop by to see me often.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.760
Sometimes, I really think

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.120
you're just feeling sorry for me.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:10.560
But I know

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.320
you just want to know

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.320
if Qin Hong's reached out to me.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.560
That's part of it, sure.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.440
You're her mom, after all.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.230
Qin Hong would never call me.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:36.640
She only has eyes for her dad.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.000
Guess who I am.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.120
We were never that close.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.120
Dad, I thought you were
on a business trip.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.760
I came back once I wrapped things up.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.760
Come and look.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.120
Come here for a sec.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.390
Look what I got

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.080
for you.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.680
This is the trendiest style right now.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.440
Only wear it on weekends.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.640
Don't wear it to school.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.320
Or your mom's gonna tell me off again.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.120
Okay.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.520
Oh, my gosh.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.520
Dad, I thought you'd forgotten.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.560
How could I?

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.320
- She was in the dark.
- You asked for it.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.440
Dad, you're the best.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.440
She didn't know her dad

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.000
was already buried in debt.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.630
To be honest,

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:34.750
Qin Hong's dad was a good father,

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.080
always thinking of her
whenever something good happened.

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:41.110
But he wasn't a good husband.

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:47.200
He insisted on starting a business
like others.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.750
He was afraid I'd find out.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.320
So, he resigned behind my back.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.200
But he wasn't made for business.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:58.230
So, later on,

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.510
how did you find out

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:01.750
that he was in debt?

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.240
Alright then.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:14.990
Here's the IOU he wrote me.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:16.350
Take a look for yourself.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.510
Qin Desheng

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:22.110
(IOU)
borrowed some money from me

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:24.400
and used your house as collateral.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.280
Now, he's missing.

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:27.130
Sorry.

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:28.110
I'll need you to transfer

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:29.480
the ownership of this house.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:30.630
No way.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:32.510
He'd never mortgage the house.

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.630
Your mom's been
calling your dad nonstop.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:36.630
But she can't get through.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:45.750
Am I being too nice to you?

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.870
Have I been too easy on you?

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.510
What are you doing?

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:53.280
- Don't touch my kid!
- Get up.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:54.710
Get up.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.400
I moved out with Qin Hong.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.040
We rented an old place in the suburbs.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.510
The place is in rough shape.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:17.870
Why keep this?

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:18.720
For memories?

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:19.600
I'm not selling this.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:20.470
Let go!

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:21.490
Let go!

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:22.750
My dad gave it to me.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:28.350
Your dad gave it to you, huh?

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:29.630
Then go find your dad!

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:30.990
Do you even realize your dad

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:32.230
has given up on you?

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:33.830
He gave it to you, huh?

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:35.110
I know.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.960
Go then!

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.350
Qin Hong kept in touch with her dad.

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:39.630
He even secretly

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.750
sent her a bunch of stuff.

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:44.920
So, every time she argued with me,

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.510
she yelled that she'd go
to Pingtan to find him.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.230
Pingtan?

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.830
Is her dad still there?

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.400
He died in an accident

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.990
at the construction site in Pingtan.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:03.920
When the accident happened,

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.630
someone from the site called me,

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.510
asking me to handle things.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.110
I told Qin Hong

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:12.400
that I wouldn't go.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.710
To me, that man was gone long ago.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.280
That's exactly why I said

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.590
I'm the last person Qin Hong
would reach out to.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:26.110
She's been upset with me
since that incident.

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.750
Who handled things in the end?

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.630
Qin Hong went on her own.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:41.990
She was only 16 back then.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.830
I have no idea how she dealt with it.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:46.400
I never asked, either.

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:50.280
Anyway, she changed after that.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.040
She moved out of my place,

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.160
dropped out of school,

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.750
and found a job at a clothing market.

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:57.400
Did you ever see her again after that?

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:58.400
Hardly ever.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.430
Just during the holidays
and the Chinese New Year.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.470
Officer Liu,

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:20.110
if you catch her someday,

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:25.510
could you let me see her?

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.990
Over the years,

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:33.510
I've come to realize a lot of things.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.280
I bear a lot of the responsibility

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.110
for what she is today.

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:46.710
After she came back
from dealing with her dad's affairs,

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.160
I noticed

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:52.510
she had

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.400
a scar here.

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:56.630
A pretty big one.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.160
Later, she got a tattoo over it,

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:07.630
maybe because she thought it looked bad.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.330
I didn't ask about it, either.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:20.870
We found

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.400
Qin Hong.

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:27.230
Where is she?

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:29.880
Pingtan.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:31.880
See?

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:33.110
What did I say?

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:35.230
She went to find her dad after all.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.710
Does she have
a congenital heart disease?

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:38.710
No.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:40.410
Are you sure?

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:42.350
Does she have any heart problems
later in life?

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:44.630
She's my daughter.
How could I not be sure?

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:46.590
She was born perfectly healthy.

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:48.270
But I'm not sure
if her heart is fine now.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.110
Officer Liu, can I see her?

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:03.870
She might be dead.

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:15.230
Keep it if you want.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:16.990
How useless.

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:28.110
Might be?

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:35.590
Is she dead or not?

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:45.630
Have you seen

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:47.470
this man before?

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:53.980
No.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.590
He said he dated Qin Hong
for a few months.

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:58.990
After he laid hands on her,

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:00.400
her heart condition flared up,

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:01.920
and she died.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.870
He's lying.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:13.590
My daughter never had heart problems.

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:26.040
He could be making it up.

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:28.870
We found a large amount

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:30.230
of Qin Hong's blood at his place.

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:33.590
It looks more like a death

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:35.510
caused by violence.

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:40.990
What about the body?

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.510
Still not found.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:54.110
That can't be right.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:56.230
I think your investigation

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.040
might have gone the wrong way.

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:05.470
Qin Hong's been on the run
for over a year.

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.870
She even managed

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:10.230
to kill Huang Shuquan.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.920
How could that jerk hurt her?

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:13.870
No way.

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:14.920
I don't buy it.

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:16.990
You must've made a mistake.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.040
Why are you still here?

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:21.750
Qin Hong hasn't been caught yet.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.590
Get moving and finish the case.

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:44.750
You're leaving?

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:47.710
Zhang.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.990
The holidays are coming up.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.830
Can you help me buy something

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:52.920
Ms. Wei likes to eat?

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.990
I can't take this, Officer Liu.

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:55.870
We've got rules.

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:56.710
We can't accept this.

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:58.160
It's fine; just don't tell anyone.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.040
No, no.

00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.950
How about this?

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:01.750
I'll put the money into her account.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:02.820
We have a supermarket.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:03.760
They've got everything.

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:04.990
She can buy whatever she wants

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:06.230
- by herself.
- Alright.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:07.070
Sure.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:08.730
- Bed 12.
- Got it.

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:09.990
Let me take a look.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.120
Her account was just topped up.

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.230
Why top up again?

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.230
200,000 was transferred last time.

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.200
How much?

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:19.120
200,000.

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:20.840
Are you sure?

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.230
Yeah.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.270
It was about two months ago.

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:27.640
Who transferred it?

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:29.640
(Zhang Yan, Pingtan City)

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.400
Pingtan City.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.850
(Pingtan City)
The sender's name is

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:32.500
Zhang Yan.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.790
Xiaoxiao, did you find anything?

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:40.670
Yeah.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:41.960
Zhang Yan's ID information

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.830
was registered in Chang'an Town
not long ago.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:44.900
She's probably still there.

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.600
I just went back
to ask Qin Hong's mother.

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:47.400
She didn't know

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.680
when the money was transferred.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.470
And she doesn't know Zhang Yan.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.440
Could that money have been wired
by Qin Hong herself?

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.550
Could Zhang Yan be another identity

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.640
Qin Hong used while on the run,

00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.790
just like Lin Chang?

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.440
That's very possible.

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:03.840
But if the money was sent
by Zhang Yan herself,

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.640
it means she knew Qin Hong.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:07.070
I'll go to Chang'an Town.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.440
Wait for me. I'll be right back.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.280
Let's go together.

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:22.820
(Pingtan, Chang'an Town, 2013)

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.710
So good to be living
in the sunlight again.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.640
Everything is worth it.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.680
How did Qin Hong's mother react?

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.270
She didn't believe Qin Hong was dead.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:44.070
Do you think she truly didn't believe it

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:45.790
or just couldn't accept the truth?

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.360
I couldn't tell.

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:51.360
Because I don't believe it, either.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.070
I have a question for you.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.640
What is it?

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.440
You seem to know Qin Hong

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.880
quite well.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:32.840
Watch your step.

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:33.910
Okay.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:35.680
That building up ahead.

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.960
Lyu Danshun.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.400
Officer Liu.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.070
You two know each other?

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.840
He's Qin Hong's younger brother.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:22.600
Her real brother?

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.960
No.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.920
She took me in as a brother.

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:35.440
Qin Hong and he were neighbors
when they were kids.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.160
They grew up together.

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:38.960
After Qin Hong's incident,

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.200
I talked to him once.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.840
Back then, you told me

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.550
you were planning to go south for work.

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.200
So, you came here, huh?

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:51.180
I used to live somewhere else

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:52.030
and just moved here.

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:52.920
Where were you?

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.300
- Pingtan.
- Where?

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:01.440
Pingtan.

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.640
Zhang Yan's ID information

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.550
was registered in Chang'an Town
not long ago.

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:08.680
She's probably still there.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:14.940
(Zhang Yan)

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:21.880
Can we go inside for a bit?

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.400
Sure.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.880
After only a year,

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:51.550
you've become a dad?

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:55.710
That's my girlfriend's kid
with her ex-husband.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.960
You two don't sleep in the same room?

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.510
The kid is still too young.

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:03.880
She needs to sleep with her mother.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.120
Plus, the bed's not big enough.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.120
So, I sleep in this room.

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:24.070
Do you know Zhang Yan?

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.200
She's my girlfriend.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.710
Where is she now?

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.160
She took the kid to town.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.680
When will she be back?

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.600
Probably not for a while.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:48.880
Then we will

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:49.880
wait for her here.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.790
I'll call her and tell her to come back.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.120
No need, really.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.240
We're not in a rush.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.120
We haven't met for over a year.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.600
Perfect time to catch up,

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:15.880
while waiting for her.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.540
You're looking for Zhang Yan?

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.680
Your girlfriend, Zhang Yan,

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:40.030
sent money to Qin Hong's mother

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:41.310
two months ago.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.470
Did you know about that?

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:44.880
I was the one who sent that money.

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:49.320
After Hong left,
no one could look after her mom.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.640
I thought I'd help out however I could.

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:56.440
Why didn't you use your own account?

00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.400
You've always thought

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.920
that Hong and I were connected.

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:03.400
I don't want more trouble
because of that.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:05.640
Do you know how much you transferred?

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.200
I transferred all the money

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.400
I earned last year.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.310
You saved 200,000 in a year?

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:25.120
What kind of job pays that well?

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.270
Come on, introduce me to it.

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:27.600
Officer Liu, to be honest,

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.360
it's not some decent job.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.550
To make money,

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.880
no job

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:37.070
is embarrassing.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.470
But it absolutely has to be legal.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:57.920
Officer Liu, I admit it.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:58.880
Hong and I

00:25:58.880 --> 00:25:59.720
used to be close.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.030
But I've moved on with my life now.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.270
There's nothing between us anymore.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.080
If you don't believe me,

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:08.900
I'll call Zhang Yan
and ask her to come back.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.220
You can ask her what happened.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.240
Go on.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.840
Did you know Qin Hong
is also in Pingtan?

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:29.960
No, I didn't.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:31.200
Really?

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.470
She hasn't tried
to reach out to you at all?

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:35.640
No.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.640
Did you catch her?

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:43.960
Qin Hong is dead.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.400
How did she die?

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.200
We haven't gotten to the bottom of it,

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.030
so I can't tell you any details.

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:24.880
Let me get you two

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.030
some tea.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.070
The tide is rising.

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:53.120
Time to go back.

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:00.270
Mengmeng.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:10.060
(Liu Wang is here. I'll hold them off.
Go and wait for my call.)

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.400
The water's boiling.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:23.760
Yes.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.680
I just talked to Zhang Yan

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.880
and told her to come back now.

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:32.790
Sorry, I lost control
of my emotions just now.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.240
I get it.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.880
- Let me.
- I got it.

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:54.600
Your girlfriend's back.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.550
Go open the door.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.600
Danshun,
I've got some fresh octopus today.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:24.790
It's for your daughter.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.720
Thanks. Let me pay you for it.

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:30.620
No need, really.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.120
Zhang Yan frequents my place.

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:32.960
No need to pay.

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:34.150
Bye.

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:35.360
Thanks.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.200
Take it slow.

00:29:58.550 --> 00:29:59.390
No rush.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.280
Go.

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:14.480
Mengmeng.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.310
How about we don't go home now?

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:00.840
Where's Officer Liu?

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.270
He went to the restroom.

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.300
Zhang Yan should be back soon.

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:14.400
She bought a lot of groceries
with the kid.

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:15.680
I'll go pick her up.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:17.600
I'll go with you.

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:18.580
It's fine.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.680
The road is tricky.

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:21.030
I'll go by myself.

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.400
Once we're back, we can eat.

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.910
Chief Liu.

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:50.600
Danshun?

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.940
He's gone to pick up Zhang Yan.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.120
To pick up Zhang Yan?

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.050
Oh, no.

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.240
Sorry.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.600
Chief Liu, I'm sorry.

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:38.070
I didn't know he'd run off.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.680
Notify the local station here.

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:43.640
Block all the roads leading out of town.

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:44.480
Got it.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.040
Let them pass.

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:00.360
Drive forward. Yeah.

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:02.550
Chief Liu.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.560
- Let them pass.
- The sheriff is here.

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:11.980
(Chang'an–Cao City)

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:15.740
(Ticket Inspector)

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.680
This is Sheriff Zhao
from the local station.

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.160
- Chief Liu.
- Thanks for your work.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.270
That guy should still be in this town.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.600
Please have your men work some overtime.

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:25.600
Don't worry, Chief Liu.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.600
(Chang'an–Cao City)
Where's Uncle Danshun?

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.360
Aren't we waiting for him?

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:31.680
Be good, Mengmeng.

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:32.880
Uncle Danshun...

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.470
He'll come find us in a bit.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.270
Everything's been arranged.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.580
Our place is pretty small,

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:42.740
and there aren't many exits.

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:43.800
We've sealed them all off.

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:45.400
Other teams are checking the town.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.270
Sheriff Zhao.

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.200
We've found Zhang Yan.

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.310
Chief Liu, Zhang Yan's been found.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:53.240
Let's go.

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:54.790
This way.

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.710
She bought the ticket

00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:59.160
a little after seven.

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:00.720
It's her.

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:05.860
(2013/12/16 Monday, Surveillance Center,
Security Checkpoint)

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.440
Stop, stop.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.030
Rewind a bit.

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.160
Stop.

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:12.190
Can you zoom in?

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:29.880
Qin Hong.

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:32.320
Qin Hong is still alive.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:33.840
Stop that bus. Hurry!

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:34.720
- Hurry!
- Got it!

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:35.920
- Move!
- Okay!

00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:41.860
(Police)

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:42.800
Passenger bus.

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.400
Pull over for inspection.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.880
Pull over for inspection.

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:01.150
Hello, we're looking for someone.

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.240
Okay, got it.

00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:19.360
Thanks.

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:20.520
Chief Liu.

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:21.620
Qin Hong isn't on the bus.

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.600
The driver said a woman
holding a child got off

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:24.920
when they just left the station.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.200
Sheriff Zhao.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:31.960
Any news from town?

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.190
Still nothing.

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:43.030
We've been played.

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:46.360
Hong?

00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:47.960
Hong?

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:50.550
Hong?

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:55.550
Uncle Danshun.

00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:58.720
Why haven't you left?

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:03.190
Mengmeng was crying hard
before getting on the bus.

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:05.240
She said she had to go with you.

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:08.840
I think Liu Wang has found me.

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:27.440
Do you think all this is worth it?

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.320
Danshun.

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:47.880
Danshun.

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:49.920
Danshun.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:52.880
Come out.

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:57.550
Danshun.

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:00.400
Didn't you hear me?

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:04.960
You brat.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.720
Are you deaf or what?

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:09.760
Why are you standing there?

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.880
Pour me a glass of water.

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:16.070
You brat.

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:19.440
Useless.

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:20.880
A bunch of ingrates.

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:35.880
Are you trying to burn me?

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:37.400
I'm sorry.

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.400
Dad, I was wrong.

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:42.400
Get back here!

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:47.440
Open the door!

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.600
Open the door!

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:50.280
Open the door!

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:51.840
You've crossed the line.

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.440
How dare you lock me out?

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:55.880
You useless thing, just like your mom.

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:57.760
Neither of you can do anything.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.760
You got a death wish, huh?

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.240
Did you hear me?

00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:02.550
You've gone too far!

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:03.880
Open the door!

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:05.440
Open it!

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:06.680
Unlock it now!

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.280
I'll teach you a lesson.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.670
Who is it?

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:16.550
Who threw that?

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:18.960
Who dared to smash my window?

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.070
Which jerk did that?

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:21.840
You got a death wish?

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:24.600
Don't run!

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:26.280
Stop running!

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.670
Stop right there!

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:29.990
Wait till I catch you!

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:48.280
Come out if you dare.

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:52.030
Playing dirty with me?

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:53.190
Come out!

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:54.920
Where are you?

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.760
How's your dad's hand?

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:17.920
Did you throw this?

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.320
Why do you keep everything?

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.470
It's called evidence.

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:21.800
This is dangerous.

00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:28.760
A bone injury takes 100 days to heal.

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:31.360
Your dad won't be able to hit you
for at least three months.

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:32.080
Go tell your dad:

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.960
There are lots of weasel traps
around our yard.

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.240
Tell him to be careful.

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:49.590
What's your name?

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.960
I'm Lyu Danshun.

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:55.960
I'm Qin Hong.
