00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:14.879
(This is the Fu family's
Jiangxing Hotel.)

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:21.519
Mr. Liu, please let me explain.

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:22.599
Our hotel follows

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:24.319
its own standardized
management procedures.

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:25.359
When I was deputy manager,

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:27.640
the lobby operated
under the same system.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.079
You can't just come in
and change things.

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:29.799
Enough.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.239
Listen, Wang.

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:33.079
Let me make this clear.

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:34.359
I was sent here by Mr. Gu.

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:36.000
My orders represent his orders.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.640
People like you

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.760
should be grateful

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.879
just to keep your jobs.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.000
Stop questioning my arrangements.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.000
And you're not even a deputy manager.

00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:45.760
Just a lobby manager.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.159
Who do you think
you are to challenge me?

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:56.280
Miss.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.159
What brings you here?

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.480
Chenyu.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.080
Don't you get what Yunyun meant?

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.000
In every drama,
when she says "I choose you,"

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.719
it means

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:13.000
she likes you.

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.240
She's basically confessing her love,
just rounded up.

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.280
"I choose you."

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:26.919
I think whatever happened between
her and Yansheng is already in the past.

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:28.919
Now her heart belongs only to you.

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:29.599
Why

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.680
don't you try being with her?

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:37.840
Mind your manners.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.080
You're my assistant intern now.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.319
Watch your words and behaviour.

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:42.400
You really feel nothing?

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.159
Gu Shiqi.

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:55.919
Miss.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.560
Back then,

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.479
Mr. Fu was right here when...

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.319
Dad.

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:26.439
You wanted to see me?

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.520
Yunyun,

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.919
this jade pendant

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.439
has been our Fu family's heirloom
for a thousand years.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.680
Legend says it can turn fate around

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.960
in times of danger.

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:36.639
Keep it safe with you

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.039
and carry it always.

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.199
It will protect you from harm.

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:41.960
That's amazing.

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:44.879
Why are you suddenly giving it to me?

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.400
There's some trouble at my company.

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:50.800
So I want you to keep it safe for now.

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:54.000
Carry it with you at all times.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.599
It will protect you from harm.

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:56.280
Dad.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.479
What happened to the company?

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:58.240
Is it serious?

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.680
It's nothing.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.439
You don't need to worry

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:04.319
and don't listen to rumors outside.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.120
I'll take care of everything soon.

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:08.240
But...

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:11.479
Listen to me.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.240
Should I call an ambulance?

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.879
Quick, make the call!

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.959
Dad, open your eyes and look at me!

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:34.519
Dad, it's me, Yunyun!

00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:35.800
You love me the most!

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.879
Please open your eyes and look at me!

00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:40.360
Someone help!

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.639
Save him!

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.560
Help!

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.439
Call someone, now!

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:47.959
Please, someone come!

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:49.720
Don't look!

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:51.519
Dad!

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:52.519
Stop taking photos!

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.160
Stop taking photos!

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.199
Don't look!

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.040
(Jiangxing Hotel Acquisition Contract)
Now creditors are everywhere.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.240
The Fu family's finances have collapsed.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.600
You can't possibly fill such a gap.

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:10.920
Sign the contract

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.160
and sell Jiangxing Hotel to me.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.959
It'll get you through this crisis.

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:17.680
My father

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.439
really took his own life?

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.519
I'm sorry for Mr. Fu's passing.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.879
Jiangxing Hotel

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:39.279
was my father's lifelong work.

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:43.800
I can't sell it.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.759
Will you just watch
Jiangxing Hotel collapse?

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.360
I give you my word.

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:52.040
I'll preserve its name and reputation.

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:55.000
I'll treat
the long-time staff with respect,

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.319
just as your father did.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:19.140
(Signature of legal representative:
Fu Yunyun)

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:22.680
(Dad,)

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.879
(one day,)

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:27.920
(I'll take the hotel back.)

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.290
Looking forward to working with you.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.439
Miss.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.240
Please don't be too sad.

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:00.680
Back then,

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.480
you sold the hotel

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:03.399
to keep JiangXing Hotel alive.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.000
Mr. Fu in heaven

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.639
would understand.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.959
I've worked
at JiangXing for over ten years.

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:09.879
To be honest,

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:11.480
I watched you grow up.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.439
There's something I must say today.

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:14.920
Miss.

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:17.399
You must be cautious of the Gu family.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.240
When the Fu family suddenly collapsed,

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.639
the Gu family profited.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.480
Can things really be that coincidental?

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.759
Also,

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:26.480
on the day your father passed,

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.279
someone saw Gu Chenyu at the hotel.

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:33.000
Maybe

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.160
Mr. Fu's death...

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:39.000
Anyway,

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.600
Gu Chenyu isn't as simple as he looks.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.759
Stay away from him.

00:07:44.079 --> 00:07:45.199
I understand.

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:46.519
Thank you,

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:47.439
Mr. Wang.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.480
I'm glad you're all right.

00:07:51.079 --> 00:07:53.959
(Could Gu Chenyu really have caused
Fu Yunyun's father's death?)

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.399
(This hotel is filled
with Fu Yunyun's memories.)

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.240

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:12.279
Our hotel restaurant here,

00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:13.759
after three months
of improvements by me,

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:15.000
I added medicinal cuisine

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.439
and nourishing hotpot to the menu.

00:08:17.519 --> 00:08:18.560
Since the changes,

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.680
business has been booming.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.480
It's packed every day.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.519
Sister-in-law...

00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:30.439
Yunyun.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.600
Inspect this place for me.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:35.559
All right.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:38.399
Come on, let's check over there.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:42.759
What's wrong?

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.240
I'm fine.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.320
Why are you here?

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.080
Do you have a moment now?

00:08:52.879 --> 00:08:53.639
Come with me.

00:09:01.679 --> 00:09:03.240
Duplicity.

00:09:13.159 --> 00:09:15.759
(Was it really him
who drove Fu Yunyun's father to death?)

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:17.879
(Maybe)

00:09:18.399 --> 00:09:19.799
(I should just ask him directly.)

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.360
Are you

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.360
feeling any better now?

00:09:29.919 --> 00:09:31.039
I'm fine.

00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:32.159
Then

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.440
maybe I should head back first.

00:09:34.639 --> 00:09:35.360
Wait.

00:09:38.159 --> 00:09:39.639
I brought you somewhere.

00:09:40.919 --> 00:09:43.159
Jiangxing Hotel was built
by your father's own hands.

00:09:44.159 --> 00:09:45.919
It must hold many memories for you.

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:48.200
Everything from your family
is still there.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.080
You can visit whenever you wish.

00:09:55.399 --> 00:09:56.840
You brought me here

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.720
just to tell me this?

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:01.120
This is for you.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:01.799
Gu!

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.080
Go to hell!

00:10:14.159 --> 00:10:14.960

Miss?

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.960
Ever since the Gu family

took over Jiangxing Hotel,

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.240
the old staff

00:10:30.519 --> 00:10:32.039
have been demoted,

00:10:32.919 --> 00:10:34.360
or outright dismissed.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.799
I've worked here nearly my whole life.

00:10:38.279 --> 00:10:40.480
Now I'm almost at retirement age

00:10:40.559 --> 00:10:42.639
and they're firing me?

00:10:42.799 --> 00:10:43.799
