00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.520
(This is a work of fiction)

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.240
In the few seconds of falling,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.000
my life flashed before my eyes.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.400
I suddenly understood many things.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.160
Too many things in this world aren't worth it.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.920
A messy life isn't worth it.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.280
A dull relationship isn't worth it.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
A baffling loop isn't worth it.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.519
None of those things are worth...

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.400
another second of my time.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.280
But there's one thing...

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.960
I must do.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.040
Good morning.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.320
Why didn't you jump?

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.640
I didn't dare to.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.360
Do you know how painful it was for me?

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.120
I don't.

00:02:13.121 --> 00:02:14.160
You'll know soon enough.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.600
That's more like it.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.440
Why should only one of us die?

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.800
You're a wicked woman.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.239
Remember, you've killed a person, you know?

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.440
You're a murderer.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.600
When I become rich,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.239
I'll definitely buy...

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.560
the bag you want the most.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.760
Then when I become rich,

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.080
I'll also buy the watch you want the most.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.920
Which watch?

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.600
The one you kept staring at...

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.000
when we went shopping last time.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.560
You must really like it.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.800
Baby.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.120
You're the best.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.720
I think we've also said these words before.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.920
When I'm with you, I don't even need to eat.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.480
I'm full from your empty promises.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.240
Don't just comment about me.

00:03:27.241 --> 00:03:28.520
Aren't you quite generous too?

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.440
It doesn't matter anymore.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.840
We've already broken up.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.080
I'm thinking,

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.880
is this projection the key to breaking the loop?

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.760
Think about it. Why did this projection change?

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.399
It's because we already did...

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.480
the content of the previous projection.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.960
The projection told us to die.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.480
You died.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.520
I died.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.280
We passed the level.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.080
Then a new projection appeared.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.240
Exactly.

00:04:06.241 --> 00:04:08.240
This new projection is a new level.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.879
It's a new mission.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.319
We just need to do the content of this projection...

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.199
and complete the mission.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.319
This is a super simple,

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.320
straightforward level-passing game!

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.680
I'm a genius.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.520
So, how many levels...

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.520
are there in this game?

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.080
I don't know either.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.640
Maybe this day will be over after the next level.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.639
How can you be sure that after completing the level,

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.720
this day will end?

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.839
Let's try and test it.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.000
It's just a game. Let's pass as many levels as we can.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.680
If you want to play...

00:04:42.681 --> 00:04:44.561
this stupid level-passing game, do it yourself.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.320
I've wasted...

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.439
enough time on you...

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.240
and this stupid loop.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.920
Where are you going?

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.600
It's none of your business,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.240
my ex-boyfriend.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.280
"Ex-boyfriend."

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.840
Come on.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.720
You're online. Let's play a couple of rounds.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.280
Dude, it's broad daylight. Aren't you going to work?

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.320
Why should I work?

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.600
What's the point of working?

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.760
Who likes going to work?

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.880
If you don't work, how do you make a living?

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.440
Hello?

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.800
Hello?

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.960
(Spend today, pay tomorrow)

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.960
Dude.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.200
To be honest,

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.560
I've achieved financial freedom.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.920
Ms. Shen,

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.920
the water is ready.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.040
All right.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.640
Come and look at the front.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.120
It's so cool.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.160
Excuse me.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.520
This is mine.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.680
(Total spending: 0.00, Good Credit)

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.400
(Post: Maybe this is how love should be...)

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.240
What is Chen Jia Wen doing?

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.760
He hasn't posted on social media all day.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.520
Who cares?

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.880
Dude,

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.120
I know Shen Meng.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.479
She's definitely...

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.520
not a player.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.160
Don't explain for her.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.120
I...

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.800
don't care at all.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.560
There was no seamless transition.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.440
It was all premeditated.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:14.960
I'm very sorry.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.440
You were cheated on.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.119
As Shen Meng's childhood friend,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.520
I feel ashamed for her.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.280
Nice, Shen Meng.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.640
You even hid it from me.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.600
Let's not talk about this today.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.760
Let bygones be bygones.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.200
The two of us...

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.280
should just drink today.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.200
Right?

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.160
Let's drink. Chen.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.640
I must drink this.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.760
I'm partly responsible for this.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.800
Cheers!

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:46.800
Cheers.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.960
Shen Meng.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.280
That...

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.520
That guy.
