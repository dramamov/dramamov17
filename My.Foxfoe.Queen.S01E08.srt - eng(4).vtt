00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.740
Your Majesty...

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.100
Xin'er.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.500
I love you so much.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.340
Xin'er.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.980
Lord Yi...

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.700
What's the matter with you?

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.620
Is Lord Yi...

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.340
Could Lord Yi be secretly
watching somewhere?

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.740
(She found out about it.)

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.900
How could that be?

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.500
It's just the two of us here.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.339
That's not it.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.740
After everything that's happened lately,

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.259
I keep seeing

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
Lord Yi's face in my mind.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.019
(This fox demon
is stirring trouble again.)

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.899
Xin'er.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.299
I know you've been frightened
these past few days.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.299
Don't worry.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.979
I shall punish Lord Yi accordingly,

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.740
so he'll never hurt you again.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.659
But...

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.659
But why do I feel like

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.140
Lord Yi is

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.940
standing right at the door,

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.340
as if he might barge in any second.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.459
Your Majesty.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.220
Don't be afraid, Xin'er.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.540
(She's no ordinary demon.)

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.460
(Looks like
I'll have to play the long game.)

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.659
Afraid not.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.780
Don't be scared.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.100
I'm afraid

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.020
I can't serve Your Majesty
in this condition.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.580
Forget it.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.260
You should rest well today.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.020
I'll come to visit you another day.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.579
Let me feed it to you.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.019
It's all right. I wouldn't
trouble Your Majesty with that.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.820
I can manage it.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.100
(This smells)

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.579
(exactly the same
as that medicine I had before.)

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.179
Your Highness,
this is the calming tea I prepared.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.459
Having a cup of it before bed

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.380
will help you sleep better.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.779
Your Majesty, why are you here?

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.540
Didn't you ask me to come here?

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.580
I didn't.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.740
(It's Liusu.)

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.500
(It turns out
she was planted by Xiling Xuan.)

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.059
(She wants my soul
to leave my body in front of Xiling Heng,)

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.660
(so he can catch me red-handed.)

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:07.859
(It seems Xiling Xuan)

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.500
(is watching from nearby.)

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.140
If that's the case...

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.700
Liusu.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.140
Your Highness.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.060
Did you call for me?

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.780
Someone tampered

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.940
with the tea I was drinking.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.580
Your Highness.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.019
I...

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.020
Don't be afraid.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.940
I didn't say it was you.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.100
It was Xiling Xuan.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.460
He's tried to harm me again and again.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.859
This time he even tampered with my tea,

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.460
almost making me expose myself
in front of Xiling Heng.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.380
How despicable!

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.380
Since he tried to kill me,

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.500
I won't show mercy either.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.419
Do you know

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.740
where the disaster victims

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.260
have been relocated?

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.520
Have you heard?

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.560
Those victims from the downtown
in the east of the city

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.379
have disappeared overnight!

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.379
They say a demon cast a spell at night

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.659
and killed them all.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.819
Ah! No wonder there was
thunder and lightning last night.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.379
I was scared to death!

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.459
Do you think Lord Yi did it?

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.900
He is a demon after all.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.620
Shush.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.380
Watch your tongue if you want to live.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.860
Your Lordship!

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.580
This is bad, Your Lordship!

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:45.900
What happened?

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.019
Before dawn today, Jiang Xin'er took
all the disaster victims in the city

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.220
and led them away.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.060
Be specific.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.019
After I showed her
where the victims were,

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.379
she suddenly got worked up.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.540
She wouldn't let me follow her anymore,

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.139
and I don't know where she took them.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.819
I have no idea what she's going to do.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.900
So I rushed back to report to you.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.900
Did she say anything else?

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.780
She...

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.819
She said you tried to get her killed,

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.379
so she wouldn't show mercy anymore.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.500
She must be planning revenge.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.580
After that snake demon incident,

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.780
the city's been spreading rumors
that I'm a demon.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.500
Could it be that she plans
to kill the victims with magic

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.380
and pin the blame on me?

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.180
Take me to her.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.140
She's right ahead.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.220
She's actually

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.860
cooked them?

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.500
That vile demon...

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.900
I must kill her!

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.700
Your Lordship.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.579
It turns out

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.380
she's been helping the victims
rebuild their homes.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.500
Miss.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.699
Hey, Niu.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:57.699
Miss.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.019
Those people had their eyes
on those pots.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.760
They've been staring at them
the whole time.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.259
Got it.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.300
Go.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.819
Madam Zhang.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.539
Why is nobody watching those pots?

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.139
My goodness, how forgetful I am!

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.600
When I get busy, I forget everything.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.939
Then hurry and go check on them.
Don't let them burn.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.060
Sure!

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:18.939
Everyone, keep it up!

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.819
We're having wild boar for dinner!

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.340
Great!

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:27.939
Your Lordship.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.900
She doesn't look like
an evil demon to me.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.300
She's just putting on an act.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:49.740
What are you doing here?

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.700
Of course I'm here to catch a demon.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:54.579
I don't know
what nonsense you're spouting.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.139
If you're not here to help,

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.459
step aside and don't get in my way.

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.140
Drop the act already.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.660
I bet these people

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.900
have all been bewitched by you, right?

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:05.819
Indeed.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.379
I bewitched them.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.580
I'm a demon. I'm a fox spirit.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.579
Not only did I bewitch these people here,

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.139
I also bewitched His Majesty.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:14.940
So you finally admit it.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.379
I'll kill you right now.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.179
Hey, what are you doing?

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.019
If she's a demon,

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:19.939
that makes me one too.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:21.339
Go ahead and kill me too.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.819
All of us here are demons.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.339
Kill us all, then!

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.779
Hey, everyone, come over!

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.139
Look at this man.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:27.779
Look at this man.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.579
He calls our life savior a monster.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.260
Look. This is it!

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.299
- What nonsense are you talking?
- What nonsense is this?

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.419
If it weren't for our life savior,

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.299
would we all be able to gather
and rebuild our homes here?

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:37.539
Indeed.

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:38.139
There, there.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:39.779
Stop talking nonsense. You know nothing.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.100
Don't be afraid, miss.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.380
I once suffered from losing my home,

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.539
so I can truly empathize

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.260
with their plight.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.500
But like I said,

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:57.739
even if I am a demon,

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.740
there are good and evil demons.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.860
I'm doing all this to make you
stop targeting me in the future.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.019
Do not harm her!

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.740
She is our life savior!

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.219
Niu.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.219
Look.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.660
This one's for you.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.940
Wow, it's so nice!

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.980
What is this?

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:20.979
This

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.059
is the lucky bird I wove.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.179
It can bless you
with good fortune and health,

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.580
a peaceful and smooth life.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.260
Why were you crying just now?

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.219
They don't want to play with me.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.179
They call me a crow

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:38.459
and an unlucky bird.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.539
You're more like a crybaby bird to me.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:41.459
I am not.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:42.619
I wasn't crying at all.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.779
It's just the sand got in my eyes.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:45.419
Okay.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.900
You weren't crying.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.859
Actually, they don't get it.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.579
Crows aren't unlucky birds.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.819
They're auspicious birds.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:52.819
Really?

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:53.859
Of course.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:54.819
Crows feed their parents,

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.099
showing filial piety.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:56.979
They eat pests.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.059
They symbolize righteousness.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.979
Since ancient times,
they've been a symbol of good omen.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.979
Tu Shanyue, you sure know a lot.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.419
Here, this is for you.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.500
What is this? It's pretty.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.300
This is the lucky bird I wove for you.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.579
It can bless you
with good fortune and health,

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.060
and a peaceful and smooth life.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:18.859
Look. Doesn't it look like you,

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:19.939
crybaby bird?

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:20.900
It does.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.660
(What are these memories about?)

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.739
(I can't help)

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.060
(feeling connected to her.)

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.820
